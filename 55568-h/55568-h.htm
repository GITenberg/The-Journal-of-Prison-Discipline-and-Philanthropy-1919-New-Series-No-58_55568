nominated were elected to the offices designated in the report of
the Committee. (See page 3.)</p>

<p>A communication was read, sent by Leonard G. Yoder, Esq.,
Solicitor for the Berks County Prison, calling attention to the fact
that the Act of the Assembly, approved 1917, provided that prisoners
in the county prisons could be employed at agricultural labor only
during the continuance of the war which is now interrupted by the
armistice. The net profit of the labor of prisoners thus employed
in Berks County in 1918 was $800, and the Solicitor recommends
that this Act should apply permanently and requests that this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Society should exert an influence on the present Assembly for the
purpose of encouraging the continuation of this beneficial measure
for the employment of prisoners. By motion, the communication
was referred to the Legislative Committee of the Acting Committee.</p>

<p>Dr. George W. Kirchwey of New York delivered the Annual
Address. He is the Counsel for the Commission under appointment
to investigate prisons and to recommend such revision of our
present penal system as may seem advisable. While the report of
the Commission was not yet entirely prepared, he intimated that
some scheme of Central Administration would be proposed, not so
much to take the management away from the present Boards of
Inspectors as to exercise advisory and supervisory powers and to
correlate our various correctional institutions. The conditions
now obtaining in regard to the employment of prisoners were deplorable
in this Keystone State, and it was the aim of the Commission
to provide some form of productive labor for all able-bodied
prisoners. They were prepared to recommend an extension of
agricultural operations and favored the early removal of the Eastern
Penitentiary to a farm in the eastern portion of the State. He
deprecated every form of brutality in the treatment of delinquents
and evidently thought the old repressive spirit and measures could
still be found to have lodgment in some of our prisons. He was
sure that a large number of our prisoners, possibly a majority,
were mentally deficient and ought to have special treatment adapted
to their needs, which, under present circumstances of incarceration,
was impossible. If we wish to restore the men whom we confine
in our prisons, we must do more than simply restrain them within
certain limits; we must treat them as erring brothers and sisters,
not as dumb driven cattle.</p>

<p>To nominate to our next Annual Meeting the officers of the
Society and members of the Acting Committee whose terms expire
next year, the President appointed William Biddle, Robert Dunning
Dripps, John A. Duncan, William C. Warren and Miss Emily Whelen.</p>

<h3 id="REPORT_OF_ACTING_COMMITTEE">REPORT OF ACTING COMMITTEE FOR THE YEAR 1918.</h3>

<p>At a meeting which was held May 8, 1787, in Philadelphia, at
which the “Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of
Prisons” was organized, provision was made for the appointment of
an Acting Committee which should discharge the executive functions
of the Society. It was composed of nine persons, the President, the
two Vice-Presidents, and six additional members. The first Acting
Committee was composed of</p>

<p class="table">
Bishop William White, President,<br />
Dr. Henry Helmuth, Vice-President,<br />
Richard Wells, Vice-President.<br />
</p>

<table>
<caption>Additional members:</caption>
  <tr>

    <td>Benjamin Wynkoop,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>William Rogers,</td>
    <td>George Krebs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>From time to time, on account of additional duties, responsibilities
and opportunities for service, this Committee has been enlarged until
at the present time it is limited to sixty persons, and at the present
time is composed of fifty-six members.</p>

<p>In 1886 the name of the Society was changed to “The Pennsylvania
Prison Society”&mdash;a name indicating no change of purpose,
but rather a wider scope of operations.</p>

<p>In the year 1829, the Acting Committee, by Act of Assembly,
were appointed Official Visitors of all prisons in the Commonwealth.
Our Society was the only one having such duties until the year 1903,
when, by another Act of the Assembly, the privilege was granted to
the Acting Committee of the Catholic Society for the Visitation of
Prisoners.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Official Visitation.</span></h3>

<p>While many members of our Visiting Committees have been
zealous in their endeavor to open the door of hope to the prisoners,
and to stimulate them to higher ideals of life, the general conditions
obtaining in the prisons have also claimed attention. It is a prescribed
function of the Visiting Committee of any prison, whether
State or County, to note the “condition of the buildings <span class="nowrap">...</span>
the discipline and management,” and to make report of their observations.
Great discretion and a full understanding of the situation
are essential in publishing the results of such comments and observations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
In the early history of our organization, there were so
many abuses prevalent in the management of prisons that by far
the larger part of the activities of the Acting Committee consisted
in the effort to remedy the evils of management. These efforts were
eminently successful in those days of emergence from medieval
methods; and while we all rejoice in the very great amelioration of
conditions, it must be confessed that penal improvement has lagged
behind all other agencies for betterment. If we compare our educational
system, hospitals, transportation methods, agricultural development&mdash;any
field of human endeavor&mdash;with our correctional institutions,
we are overwhelmed by the extreme lack of corresponding
progress.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Personal Visitation.</span></h3>

<p>The reports of the Visiting Committees for the year 1918 indicate
that there is no loss of interest or effort in seeking to restore men and
women to their better selves. In consequence of the quarantine
caused by the epidemic of influenza, which resulted in keeping
visitors away from four to six weeks, the statistics do not bulk as
large as usual.</p>

<p>On practically every Sabbath one or more of our members take part
in the religious services in the prisons.</p>

<p>We are convinced that many of those with whom we meet from
time to time are victims of circumstances, and also that many of
them are defective in mentality and in self control. At some time,
we trust the General Assembly will take up seriously the subject of
the degenerates who need treatment in accordance with the most
approved psychiatric methods. Some of them need institutional
care for a much longer time than is indicated by the Court sentence.
Here they should be restrained until they are deemed ready to become
useful to the community.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Employment of Prisoners.</span></h3>

<p>In the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the most flagrant
evil of the prisons is the lack of wholesome employments for the
inmates. Even some of our laws designed to help conditions have
aggravated the evil. For instance, the law of 1913, which, with the
best intentions, repealed other laws for employment in the State
Penal Institutions, in order that the inmates might all be employed
in making articles for State use, did not create a sure market for the
articles thus manufactured, and therefore the number of prisoners
profitably employed in the penitentiaries is not so large as under a
former law when 35 per cent. of them could be kept at work in the
manufacture of articles or products to be sold in the open market.
A simple remedy for this deplorable state of affairs may be found in
granting the privilege of selling the surplus stock in the market at the
prevailing price. Organized labor found undesirable competition
with the products of free labor only when the prisoners were employed
on the vicious contract system. Under the present methods, the
prisoners are to receive a fair wage and the products are to be sold
at the market price. Perhaps we could make a beginning by listing
certain industries in which the convicts may be employed. Place no
restrictions on agricultural products, including canned goods, on the
work of stone crushing and in general the manufacture of road-making
material, and also allow two or three indoor industries, such as the
manufacture of carpets and knit goods. Thus the problem may be
solved. When we consider the very small number of persons so
employed in comparison with the hordes of outside workers, it appears
very evident that the amount of real competition would reduce to
the vanishing point. No industry would be injured, the tax-payers
would be relieved from a large part of the expense, the prisoners
would earn their own maintenance, and thus the demoralizing effects
of idleness would be averted.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Discharged Prisoners.</span></h3>

<p>It has sometimes been stated that for some visitors, the prisoner
loses his charm when released from confinement. He may be decidedly
interesting behind the bars, or perhaps he may be simply
an object of curiosity, or a psychological specimen to be studied,
like some abnormal freak of nature. Within the wall the visitor
may show warmth, interest, cordiality, sympathy, a certain degree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of familiarity, but on the outside the atmosphere is below zero.
This is a species of charlatanism for which we have no sympathy.
It is an exceedingly important part of our mission to set the discharged
man on his feet, and to establish his goings. If ever any
man needed sympathy and material aid, it is when the man released
from confinement again becomes a member of the community. Not
all the men and women who are released seem to require special
help, but those who are in need are very greatly dependent upon
human kindness till they have regained some sense of confidence and
have again become self-supporting. If aid and good cheer are not
forthcoming at this crucial time of testing, there is imminent danger
of a relapse into former bad habits. We believe that all of our
visitors realize the importance of maintaining our interest and
kindly feeling for the prisoner at the time of his release.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Securing Employment.</span></h3>

<p>During the last two years there has been no difficulty in finding
work for any able-bodied man. There are some disappointments,
but we are learning not to become discouraged. Possibly we may
allow ourselves to dwell unduly on the failures, when we should
recall the many instances of reclamation. The saying “Once a
crook, always a crook” has no place either in our experience or in
our philosophy. If this saying represents a truth, we would become
pessimistic regarding the human race. Show us the man or woman
who has never erred. Please note some examples:&mdash;</p>

<p>The other day we met “A” on Market Street. Accompanied
by his little son, he was speeding away in his “flivver.” He stopped
to give us a greeting, and indicated that happiness and prosperity
were his portion.</p>

<p>“B” is a spick and span policeman in a neighboring city. Though
you may say “Set a thief to catch a thief,” this particular guardian
of the public peace is discharging his duty to the community.</p>

<p>“C” seemed particularly pleased to meet us the other day
uptown. He had joined the church, and had attained to the dignity
of usher.</p>

<p>“D,” who was once an accomplished burglar, having served at
least two terms in prison, has built up a manufacturing industry,
and is quite prosperous.</p>

<p>“E” is foreman in the jewelry department of a large department
store “somewhere in America.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

<p>“F,” a one-armed piece of ebon jollity, is one of the handiest
men employed on a certain prosperous truck farm.</p>

<p>“G,” who began cooking for Blank Firm at $10 weekly wages,
now reports with a grin that he is getting $65 a month with board
and lodging.</p>

<p>“H” is one of the most popular clerks in the office of a mammoth
establishment. That he once fell from grace is known, but it
is no longer reckoned against him.</p>

<p>“I” one year ago began as a solicitor and now his business has
so enlarged that he has taken a suite of rooms for his office.</p>

<p>We could easily exhaust the alphabet with such cases. There
are failures, but we try to discount our disappointments when we
take account of those who are “making good.” The Parole Officers
have informed us that seventy-five per cent. are becoming satisfactory
citizens. By far the larger part of those whom we willingly
assist, in a short time are beyond our ken. They take with them
our hopes and our fears&mdash;our fears, that they may again yield to the
manifold temptations on every hand; our hopes, that they have
learned their lesson, and with courage and by the help of divine
grace are performing their duty to the community.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Revolving Relief Fund.</span></h3>

<p>A few of those to whom we render assistance return a part, or
all, of the funds which we have advanced to them. We do not
press them for payment. Those who are invalids or who have
families to support are not expected to repay us. From many years
of experience, we have learned that it is not wise indiscriminately
to make grants of cash in hand. Old chums are waiting just around
the corner for a treat. Temptations of all sorts are manifold. We
guarantee bills for board and lodging, purchase tools and clothing,
furnish transportation, and provide outfits for those who are sent to
the State Sanatoriums. But there are some who should feel an obligation
to return the value of the assistance rendered. Thus we hope
to create a sort of revolving fund which may be used for cases of
need, and when returned is ready for the next man. Many of these
released men have some natural pride or self respect, and do not
wish to be considered mendicants.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The American Prison Association.</span></h3>

<p>On account of the epidemic of influenza so prevalent in the
autumn, the meeting of the American Prison Association was called
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
off. At a meeting of the Executive Committee held recently it was
concluded to postpone till next year the sessions of this body. New
York had been selected as the place, and it has been decided to
meet in the same city, October 20-24, 1919.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Agent’s Work at the Central Police Station.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most important features of our relief work is under
the management of our Agent, Mr. Fred J. Pooley, at the Central
Station, City Hall. From the forty-two Police Stations throughout
the city, there arrive almost hourly at this Central Station van
loads of human freight which in some way or other must be quickly
disposed of by the Committing Magistrate. Most of these are
petty offenders, but also there are numerous cases of arrest on suspicion
or for vagrancy, and such as these need special care in order
to prevent injustice, and to be saved from criminal associations.
Agent Pooley endeavors to have a brief interview with these derelicts
or victims of misfortune before they are taken before the
Magistrate. In ten months of last year he thus interviewed 15,933
arrested persons, and on their behalf wrote to their friends 1,937
letters. His experience for many years has taught him to distinguish
the ring of the true from the sound of the false, so that
when the cases come up before the Court, he is ready to interpose
a word on behalf of the accused person. Often the unfortunate
man or woman, boy or girl, is placed in the care of the agent, who
sends them to their homes or friends, or places them in some detention
home until he may verify their story or hear from their parents
or relatives. No day passes with a blank record in this work of
rescue.</p>

<p>In the Agent’s report, an abstract of which is printed in the
Annual Journal of which this report forms a part, a number of
instances are narrated, illustrating the importance of this service.</p>

<p>During the time of the closing of the saloons on account of the
epidemic of influenza, the number of arrests for drunkenness and
disorderly conduct greatly decreased, thus clearly demonstrating
that a prohibitory law would have a decided tendency very greatly
to diminish crime and disorder in this city.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Legislation.</span></h3>

<p>We have delayed the printing of our annual report in order to
include in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span> the Report of the Commission to Investigate
Prison Systems, of which the Secretary of the Society is a member.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
The Legislative Committee of the Society has endorsed the findings
of the Commission and has urgently requested the General Assembly
to take favorable action on the bills presented by the Commission.
A synopsis of these bills presents the following desirable features.</p>

<p>1. The enlargement of the functions of the State Board of Public
Charities so as to include the appointment from their number of a
Committee on Delinquency with supervisory power over all prisons
of the Commonwealth and with authority to condemn unsanitary
conditions and provide for betterment, and also to have especial
direction over the prison industries. Medical and psychiatric examination
of convicts is provided with power to transfer defective criminals
to the institution most suitable for their care and restoration.</p>

<p>2. The establishment of State Industrial Farms to which those
sentenced to the county jails may be sent.</p>

<p>3. An Amendment to the law of 1911 which deals with the
imposition of sentences by the Courts to the extent that convicted
prisoners may be eligible for parole when one-third of the maximum
sentence has expired.</p>

<p>4. Abolition of the fee system in county jails, a practice universally
condemned by all who have studied the problem.</p>

<p>5. The removal of the Eastern Penitentiary to a farm in the
eastern part of the State. This suggestion is in line with the recommendation
of the Commission of 1915 of which the present Warden
was a member. At that time the purchase of a farm for the use of
the institution was proposed.</p>

<p>6. The provision that goods and articles made by the labor of
prisoners shall be used whenever practicable by public institutions
of the Commonwealth, thus insuring a market for such products.</p>

<p>The full report of the Commission is found in the present issue of
the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>, pages 19-46.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Roll of Members.</span></h3>

<p>During the last year we have to a considerable extent enlarged
the membership of our Society. We presented the matter to a
number of our citizens, many of whom had been contributors to
our work for some time, who very cordially accepted membership.
Seventy-five persons have been added to our membership during the
year 1918, and we are deeply gratified to place on our roll the names
of so many estimable citizens. The number of members at the present
time, including life members, is 252.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<h3 id="OBITUARIES"><span class="smcap">Mortuary Notices.</span></h3>

<p>During the last year four of the members of the Acting Committee
have been called away by death.</p>

<p>In January our dear friend, Mrs. Elizabeth M. Gormly, who has
faithfully visited for many years the prisoners in Pittsburgh, died at
an advanced age. She had been a member since 1903. She was also
connected with the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, being
the State Superintendent of Evangelistic Work among Prisoners.</p>

<p>In August, Mrs. Annie Fassitt, of Philadelphia, also of an
advanced age, passed from works to rewards. She had been a
member from 1896, and had given special assistance to hundreds of
prisoners. She was one of the founders of the “Door of Blessing,”
and for many years was prominent in the support and management
of this effort for the restoration of erring sisters. She was a real
“Angel of Mercy.”</p>

<p>John Smallzell, a member since 1905, also passed away in the
month of August. His visits to Eastern Penitentiary will long be
remembered. Wherever he went, he took a message of good cheer.
He was most sincere and devout, and carried with him everywhere
the influence of a devoted Christian life.</p>

<p>In April, 1919, our esteemed Vice-President Joseph C. Noblit,
in the eighty-sixth year of his life, was called to his everlasting home.
He was elected a member of the Society in 1899 and was made a
member of the Acting Committee in 1900. In 1916 he was chosen
as one of the Vice-Presidents, and on occasion presided at the meetings
of the Acting Committee with dignity and a high sense of
responsibility. He was a diligent attender of the meetings and his
judgment on the many matters coming before the Committee was
sound and discreet. He was a faithful visitor to the inmates of our
prisons, earnest in the endeavor to bring to them a true gospel
message and to induce them to choose the better way of living.
He knew the deep principles of experimental religion, and was
solicitous that all with whom he came in contact should know for
themselves the consolations of a devoted Christian life. “He giveth
his beloved sleep.”</p>

<h3 id="REPORT_OF_GENERAL_AGENT">REPORT OF GENERAL AGENT FREDERICK J. POOLEY.</h3>

<p>During the year 1918 the Agent made daily visits to the cell-room
at the Central Station at City Hall. Twenty thousand and
thirty-nine men and women prisoners were detained there for
preliminary trial, 15,933 of whom the Agent visited while at the
Central Station and the remainder after they arrived at
Moyamensing Prison.</p>

<p>The opportunities for helpful service are very numerous. In a
large number of cases of suspicion or of a trivial character, the Agent
has been instrumental in securing the discharge of the prisoners,
or in placing them under the care of the Probation Officer, thus
saving their family from disgrace and the County from expense.</p>

<p>It might be of interest to mention a few cases of interest.</p>

<p>No. 1. A young man from the west, arrested as a suspicious
character, had been from home nine years, and was held for a hearing.
The Agent got in touch with his relatives and he was discharged
and sent home.</p>

<p>No. 2. A young man from Pittsburgh, Pa., money all gone,
while pawning his watch was arrested; the pawnbroker thought he
had stolen it, and when your Agent received word from his mother
that it was his own watch, he was discharged and sent home.</p>

<p>No. 3. Two young men from St. Louis, with no money, were
held as suspicious characters in order to give the Agent a chance
to get in touch with relatives. One mother came on, and the other
sent ticket, and they both went home.</p>

<p>No. 4. A young man who had gone from town to town, ashamed
to write home, until he landed in our City Hall cell. A few words
from the Agent, brought tears to his eyes and he allowed a letter to
be written. The magistrate discharged him and he is now at home,
and he writes: “I am so glad you found me when you did, for
your letter found my mother and brought her to my rescue, and
now <i>I am free</i> and expect to keep in the right path the remainder
of my life.”</p>

<p>With the close of the year 1918, your Agent completed 20 years
of service at the Philadelphia County Prison and eight years of
service at the Central Police Station, City Hall, and in all these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
years your Agent has not lost sight of the fact that it is the kind
word and a kindly grasp of the hand, at the proper moment, that
may be the means of turning an unfortunate from the wrong to the
right path.</p>

<p>Less than six per cent. of the entire number have vanished. It
must not be considered that all of these have committed crime.
Doubtless many of them have been in the trenches. They have
broken connection with the parole officials in order to serve Uncle
Sam, who has stated that he will not accept those who have been
guilty of felony. From outside sources, we have known that a large
number of former convicts have thus endeavored to expiate their
former offenses. Much praise has been given to ex-convicts in
Canada and Great Britain from which countries many were released
in order to join the army or navy. In fact very few of these
absconders are supposed to have again committed crime. Nearly
every penal institution of the country receives notice of these
decampers accompanied by their photographs, so they are easily
identified. The few who again committed some crime have thus
been detected and either returned whence they came or held with
detainers. Probably nearly all of them desire to get entirely away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
from any restraint or semblance of authority. They make a grievous
mistake for they are liable at any time to be apprehended and to be
brought back in disgrace. They live the life of hunted animals.
Never for one hour can they feel secure. We believe that a penalty
should be levied upon those who abuse the privilege of parole. They
have violated their word of honor, and should serve additional time.</p>

<p>There are some persons who will argue against the granting of
parole because some eight and one-half per cent. of these obtaining this
privilege have again been guilty of violations of law and order. Nearly
all these violations are of the nature of misdemeanors. Comparatively
few have been guilty of felonies. The problem involves a deep study
of human psychology. In order to determine who shall be released,
there are many elements to be considered. Mistakes are made both
within and outside the prison walls. Those on the inside often give
the applicant the benefit of their doubts when the logic of the case
seems to urge further detention. When the man is on the outside
he is often disappointed in the attitude of the community of which he
really desires to become a law-abiding citizen. The members of the
community assume a serious responsibility when they put stumbling-blocks
in the way of the man who is endeavoring to make good.
“Woe to that man by whom the offense cometh.”</p>

<p>But the conclusion is irresistible that an argument against release
on parole, based on the fact that about eight per cent. have again
become lawbreakers, is a stronger argument against release at expiration
of sentence.</p>

<p>For a much larger percentage than eight per cent. of those who
are released because their terms have expired and therefore can not
longer be detained, become recidivists. Often one-half of the
prisoners at a penal institution have served previously, and yet a
comparatively small percentage are parole violators. In other words,
the same argument which is used against release on parole will apply
more strongly to any release whatever. Again, it must be remembered
that the paroled man or woman is under watchful care, while
the person absolutely released is subject to no restraint.</p>

<p>Out of every 100 persons reported January 1, 1919, as being on
parole, 74 were making good. Of the remaining 26, barely two have
committed felonies. This record is better than Boards in some other
States have reported. Our Parole Officials are giving deep study to
this subject with a view to increasing the percentage of successful
effort.</p>

<span id="PENAL_SYSTEMS_REPORT_OF_COMMISSION" class="large">REPORT OF COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE
PENAL SYSTEMS.</span></h2>

<p><i>To the General Assembly</i>:</p>

<p>Your Commission duly appointed pursuant to Act of the Legislature,
No. 409, 1917, “to investigate the prison systems and the
organization and management of correctional institutions within
this Commonwealth and elsewhere; to recommend such revision
of the existing prison system within this Commonwealth, and the
laws pertaining to the establishment, maintenance and regulation
of State and County correctional institutions within this Commonwealth
as it shall deem wise, and to report the same to the General
Assembly at the session of 1919,” respectfully submits the following
report of its proceedings, together with its conclusions and recommendations
and proposed bills for carrying the same into effect.</p>

<p>The Commission was constituted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fletcher W. Stites, Narberth, Chairman,<br />
Alfred E. Jones, Uniontown,<br />
Mrs. Martha P. Falconer, Darling P. O.,<br />
Louis N. Robinson, Swarthmore,<br />
Albert H. Votaw, Philadelphia.</p></blockquote>

<p>On November 1, 1917, the members of the Commission met in
the City of Philadelphia, for the purpose of organization and assigned
the work of investigation which had been committed to it to the
several members thereof. On July 1, 1918, the Commission retained
Dr. George W. Kirchwey, of New York City, as its counsel to direct
the subsequent course of the investigation and to aid the Commission
with his counsel and advice.</p>

<h3>I.<br />

<span class="smcap">Scope of Investigation.</span></h3>

<p>The Commission was fortunate in having in its personnel as
thus constituted four members, including its counsel, who had
through long experience and previous investigations acquired considerable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
information as to penal institutions and their management
in this and other States. The investigation covered:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A careful study and analysis of the laws governing penal
conditions and institutions in this Commonwealth;</p>

<p>(2) An examination of the six correctional institutions directly
controlled by the State, namely:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Eastern Penitentiary, at Philadelphia;<br />
The Western Penitentiary, at Pittsburgh;<br />
The New Central Penitentiary, at Bellefonte;<br />
The State Industrial Reformatory, at Huntingdon;<br />
The Pennsylvania Training School, at Morganza;<br />
The State Industrial Home for Women, at Muncy;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>(3) A similar examination of the Glen Mills Schools&mdash;the Girls’
Department, Sleighton Farms, at Darlington, and the Boys’ Department
at Glen Mills;</p>

<p>(4) A similar examination of the Philadelphia House of Correction
and of the County Convict Prison at Holmesburg, Moyamensing
Prison in Philadelphia, the Allegheny County Workhouse at Hoboken
and many other county institutions;</p>

<p>(5) A study of the constitution, organization and functions of
the State Board of Public Charities, and specifically of those of its
Committee on Lunacy;</p>

<p>(6) A study of the powers and activities of the Prison Labor
Commission instituted under the Act of June 1, 1918;</p>

<p>(7) A careful survey of the entire history of the penal system
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from the colonial period
down to the present time, based on the historical research of Professor
Harry E. Barnes of Clark University, Massachusetts;</p>

<p>(8) An investigation of significant correctional institutions in
several other States, notably in New York, New Jersey and Ohio.</p>

<p>To supplement and enlarge the range of these inquiries and
studies, the Commission was permitted to avail itself of the results
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
of previous investigations conducted by two of its members; on the
Employment and Compensation of Prisoners in Pennsylvania,
by Professor Louis N. Robinson, as Secretary of the Penal Commission
of 1913-1915, and on the county jails and workhouses,
made periodically from 1914 to 1918 by Albert H. Votaw, as Secretary
of the Pennsylvania Prison Society.</p>

<p>The Commission desires to express its sense of deep obligation
to the officials and inspectors of prisons in this Commonwealth for
the courtesy and hospitality extended to its members in the course
of their investigations. It also acknowledges its indebtedness to the
Secretary and members of the Board of Public Charities and to the
Secretary of the Public Charities Association for their helpful co-operation.</p>

<p>The Commission has heretofore submitted to the Governor two
preliminary reports, one a Special Emergency Report on Prison
Labor, bearing date September 1, 1918, and a special report on the
State Industrial Home for Women, under date of September 15,
1918, both of which are hereto appended.</p>

<p>While both these reports were called out by war emergencies,
the former by the dearth of labor power to man the war industries
of the Commonwealth, the latter by the need of providing a place
for the detention and treatment of the large number of dissolute
women convicted of offenses against Federal and State laws enacted
for the protection of the soldiers in the training camps&mdash;the Commission
believes that they are still pertinent and that the recommendations
which they contain should form a part of any constructive
scheme for the improvement of the penal system of the Commonwealth.</p>

<h3>II.<br />

<span class="smcap">Development of Penal System of Pennsylvania.</span></h3>

<p>The most inspiring and significant chapter in the history of
penology is not the achievement of John Howard in redeeming the
common gaols of England from the degradation into which they had
fallen, nor of Lord Romilly in his lifelong struggle against the barbarities
of the English penal laws, but the leadership which for more
than a century the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania gave to the
world both in prison reform and in the amelioration of the penal code.
The two former were the revolt of sensitive and humane natures
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
against hoary abuses; but the latter was all this and something
more. It was a bold and imaginative reconstruction of the whole
basis of penal discipline. As far back as the last quarter of the
seventeenth century the Quaker colonists of Pennsylvania introduced
for the first time the practice of employing imprisonment at hard
labor as the ordinary method of punishing anti-social action. After
the reversion of the American colonies for fifty years to the barbarous
criminal jurisprudence of the mother country, Pennsylvania was the
first State, the first community in the world, to break with this
system and to substitute imprisonment for the various brutal and
degrading types of corporal punishment. The Walnut Street Jail
in Philadelphia, in 1790, was the earliest institution in America in
which these more enlightened principles were put into practice.
From this second beginning, for a period of forty years, Pennsylvania
was elaborating and perfecting the first of the two great systems of
penal administration which were destined to dominate the penology
of the civilized world during the nineteenth century&mdash;the separate
confinement of malefactors. Visited, admired and imitated by large
numbers of eminent and enthusiastic European penologists, the Eastern
Penitentiary at Cherry Hill was the pivotal point linking American
and European penology for more than a generation after
1830.</p>

<p>Then followed that long period of inertia, of lassitude, of marking
time, which is so apt to succeed to a period of ardent reforming
energy and which to this very day has maintained its spell over
the State and the Nation.</p>

<p>Not that there have not in the last half century been notable
improvements in the theory and practice of penal administration,
some of them bold enough to bring America from time to time into
the forefront of interest and example to the penologists of the Old
World, but in most of these the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
has been content to play a secondary role. Throughout this era of
slackened energy she has not cared or dared to initiate, to lead, to
“carry on,” but has followed belatedly and afar off the progress of
other States. Examples of this are the Auburn congregate system,
which divided with the Pennsylvania system of solitary confinement
the interest of European as well as of American penologists,
and which was adopted in the Western Penitentiary in 1869, a full
generation after its establishment in New York State, and which
has only recently conquered the parent institution on Cherry Hill;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the justly famous Elmira experiment of progressive classification
and industrial training of inmates embodied in the Huntingdon
Reformatory in 1889, and the long-promised reformatory for women
at Muncy, which, six years after its creation by legislative action,
has not yet been rendered available for the purpose for which it was
designed.</p>

<p>The first step in the development of an intelligent conception
of delinquency and its treatment came not in an accurate conception
of the nature of crime and its causes, but in a clearer and more
correct notion of the function of punishment. By 1790 the element
of deterrence in punishment was recognized and emphasized. The
element of reformation was a cardinal point in the theory and
practice of the Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of
Public Prisons, and this Society did its best to infuse this doctrine
into the Pennsylvania system of prison administration. Before
1830 it was very generally asserted that reformation, as well as
deterrence and social revenge, was to be regarded as a chief aim of
punishment, though the offender was still regarded as an unregenerate
free moral agent.</p>

<p>This theory of crime received a severe shock in the “forties”
from the investigations of Dorothea L. Dix and others, who showed
the great prevalence of insanity and idiocy among the delinquent
classes. It could scarcely be denied even by the traditional jurists
that the exercise of free will was likely to be seriously impeded by
insanity or feeble-mindedness. From 1850 to the beginning of the
present century the most notable advances toward a more intelligent
conception of crime and its treatment consisted in the gradual but
definite triumph of the notion of detention and punishment as
agencies for reformation rather than as instruments of social
revenge.</p>

<p>For more than a century of its history the penal, reformatory
and correctional institutions of Pennsylvania were limited to the
county jails and the few and scattered workhouses, which were
erected mainly in conjunction with the almshouses. In the jails
there could be no approach to anything like a differentiated treatment
of delinquents. In them were herded promiscuously those
imprisoned for debt, those convicted of crime and those accused or
held as witnesses; those of all ages and both sexes; those convicted
of all categories and grades of crime punishable by imprisonment;
those of all mental states&mdash;normal, feeble-minded, neurotic, psychotic,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
epileptic. The few colonial workhouses were employed as
little more than an agency for suppressing vagrancy.</p>

<p>The first step in a differentiated treatment of crime and criminals
came with the erection of a semi-state prison in the Walnut Street
Jail in 1789-90. This provided for a partial differentiation between
those convicted of the more serious crimes and those convicted of
petty offenses or awaiting trial. It did not however, attempt any
scientific differentiation on the basis of age, sex or mental state.
Children and adults, male and female, sane and insane, were confined
in contiguity. The opening of the State penitentiaries at Allegheny
and Philadelphia in 1826 and 1829, with their fundamental principle
of solitary confinement, carried further the process of differentiation,
but still continued to apply the same general type of treatment
to all incarcerated inmates. It was a system of separation rather
than of a differentiated treatment of special types of prisoners.</p>

<p>The second important development in the direction of specialization
in the provision of institutional treatment of delinquents
appeared in the establishment of a House of Refuge for juvenile
delinquents in Philadelphia in 1828. Though this was at first a
private rather than a State institution and was of very limited
capacity, it marked an epoch in the progress of Pennsylvania penology
by making possible some elementary differentiation on the basis
of age, degree of criminality and relative susceptibility to reformation.
The next attempt at further differentiation came with the erection
of the State Hospital for the Insane at Harrisburg between 1841 and
1851, chiefly as a result of the agitation initiated by Dorothea L. Dix.
This and the other State hospitals for the insane, subsequently
erected, provided for a treatment of the more important types of
mental disorder, though no adequate provision was made for removing
the insane from the prison. Not until 1905 was an act passed
providing for the erection of a State hospital for the criminal insane
at Fairview which was opened in 1912.</p>

<p>During the quarter of a century following 1850 there was an
active agitation to provide a means of differentiating the treatment
of criminals on the basis of age, sex and degree of criminality. The
first important achievement in this direction was the further development
of reform schools for juvenile delinquents through the removal
and enlargement of the Philadelphia House of Refuge in 1850-54
and the erection of the Western House of Refuge at Allegheny during
the same period. Juvenile delinquents, if petty offenders, could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
thereafter be removed from their degrading confinement in the
state prison or worse county jails and receive the properly specialized
treatment which their circumstances demanded. No provision for
the differentiated treatment of the less definite and confirmed types
of adult delinquents was made until the opening of the reformatory
for men at Huntingdon in 1889 and the authorization of the State
Industrial Home for Women at Muncy in 1913. The provision of
reformatories and juvenile correctional institutions marked a double
process of differentiation, in that these institutions not only called
for a diversity of treatment according to age, sex and degree of
criminality, but also from the fact that they were clearly differentiated
from the State prisons and the county jails in making reformation
rather than punishment or detention their chief aims.</p>

<p>Along with this development of a properly differentiated system
of treating the delinquent population, has gone the growth of specialized
institutions for dealing with the closely related class of defectives,
which was once treated indiscriminately along with the delinquent
classes when its members were guilty of criminal action.
The State institution for feeble-minded at Polk, opened in 1893, and
at Spring City, provided by an act of 1903, and the State Village for
Feeble-minded Women at Laurelton, not yet available for use, are
designed to furnish scientific treatment for large numbers of those
who would today be confined in the state prisons or county jails, if
the ideas and institutions of 1840 prevailed. Even an institution for
inebriates was contemplated in an act of 1913.</p>

<p>But this vital and all important process of the differentiation,
classification and specialized treatment of the delinquent and
defective classes has now proceeded far beyond that most elementary
stage of furnishing separate institutions for dealing with the most
general classes of delinquents and defectives. It has been found
that the terms defective, insane and criminal have only a legal
significance and are practically useless when involving the problem
of exact scientific analysis and treatment. Each general class of
delinquent boys, of defective girls or of criminal adults, for instance,
is made up of distinguishable and distinct types which demand
specialized treatment in the same way that it is required for one
general class as distinguished from another. Though it is as yet very
imperfectly developed, the present tendency is for each institution
to differentiate into a number of specialized departments, each
designed to provide the proper treatment for one of these types.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span></p>

<p>Finally, within the last decade beginnings have been made in
what is likely to be an important future development, namely the
non-institutional care of the less pronounced and confirmed types of
delinquents, particularly of delinquent minors. The developments
along this line have, up to the present, consisted chiefly in the
adoption of parole systems in all the State penal, reformatory and
correctional institutions and in a more liberal use of the suspended
sentence and probation. The recently established Municipal Probation
Court of Philadelphia is a pioneer in Pennsylvania in this
promising new development in the preventive treatment of the less
confirmed type of delinquents.</p>

<p>Looking at the whole matter as it stands today, it cannot be
said that conditions in Pennsylvania are in any material respect
either better or worse than in other progressive States, except in
the one matter of the useful employment of the convict population.
Here, as elsewhere, some lucky chance has placed a man or a woman
of exceptional qualifications at the head of an institution, one who
has by his strong personal initiative made the best of a bad situation,
as in the case of the Eastern Penitentiary, or who has, with
something akin to genius, seized upon a new opportunity, as in the
case of the Girls’ School at Darlington and the new Penitentiary
foundation at Bellefonte. But these are sporadic and exceptional
developments and have furnished no new principle of a revolutionary
character to mark the dawn of a new era in penal administration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hopeless and demoralizing idleness to which most
of the inmates of the Eastern Penitentiary and of most of the county
institutions of the Commonwealth are doomed, is a spectacle in
which the people of Pennsylvania can take nothing but shame.
But even if this is remedied, as it should be at once by drastic
legislative action, Pennsylvania will have done no more than reach
the level of penological theory of the Quaker innovators of the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The step is an imperative
one, but it will not restore to the Commonwealth the proud position
of leadership which once was hers, which is still, by virtue of past
achievements and by common fame, attributed to her.</p>

<p>While we have thus been dreaming, tardily and ineffectually
putting into effect the aspirations of a long-distant past, a new
penology has come into being, based not on humanitarian sentiment
or on “the common sense of most,” but on the scientific study
of the delinquent and his environment. New sciences of psychology,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
psychiatry and sociology have been forged to meet the
conditions of the new day and these have furnished us with a new
basis for penological experimentation. We have learned that the
criminal is not merely a person who has in the exercise of an unfettered
will chosen the evil rather than the good, but a person of
complex personality shaped by heredity and environment to what
he is, none the less a menace to society than the older conception
made him, not the less requiring restraint and correction, but
demanding and deserving individual treatment according to the
nature which has been developed in him. We have learned from
recent scientific study of the most rigorous and trustworthy sort
that from 50 to 60 per cent. of the inmates of our correctional institutions
are abnormal&mdash;feeble-minded, insane, psychopathic&mdash;to
the point of irresponsibility, to all intents and purposes the same
kind of people that fill our hospitals for the insane and institutions
for the feeble-minded. We have also learned, from sociological
case studies, that a very large proportion of those that the psychiatrist
would class as normal are the victims of neglected childhood
and of the depraving influences of the institutions in which
they have spent a great part of their young lives.</p>

<p>It seems clear that this new knowledge makes for a new classification,
based not, like that of the Elmira system, on behavior in
confinement, nor, like that of the current penology, on the character
of the crime committed, but on the exact study of the individual
and that the treatment accorded him must be adapted to the results
of such study.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the new opportunity for a further advance out of
this slough of despond&mdash;an opportunity not inferior to that which
this Commonwealth so superbly grasped in its heroic youth&mdash;to
bring its penal administration into conformity with the newer
conceptions of delinquency. Tinkering the old machine is not
enough. It must be remodeled altogether. Adding to the powers
of a board of inspectors here, curbing them there, setting up new
boards and commissions to direct the doing of this, to restrain the
doing of that&mdash;all these are but a part of the old game, which will
after all continue to be played in very much the old perfunctory
way. What is demanded is a genuine reconstruction of the penal
system of the Commonwealth, one which shall, with as little disturbance
to the existing management of the several institutions as
possible, put at their service all the resources of the new knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
of crime and its treatment. It is the purpose of this report
to suggest the lines of this future development of our penal

<span class="smcap">General Characteristics of Present Penal System.</span></h3>

<p>As the foregoing outline indicates, the several State institutions
of a penal, correctional and reformatory character, with the two
Glen Mills Schools (which, though largely under private management,
are essentially public institutions) have been developed at
different times, under the influence of changing conceptions of social
responsibility for different types of offenders. As a result of this
circumstance each is separately managed by a board of inspectors or
managers, which exercises complete control over the policy of the institution
to which its authority extends. This Board appoints the
Warden or Superintendent, fixes his or her compensation, determines
the industrial and educational policy of the institution and, under
the authority of the Legislature, disburses the funds appropriated
for its maintenance. The disciplinary policy of the institution is
almost invariably entrusted to the Warden or Superintendent and,
as is natural, if that official happens to be a person of strong individuality
and initiative, his policy in practice, if not in theory, governs
the entire administration. Nowhere is there a centralized authority
exercising a general control or an effective influence. The only
approach to such a general agency is the State Board of Public Charities,
which may investigate and require the submission of an annual
report, and the Prison Labor Commission, which exercises a general
supervision over the industries of the two penitentiaries and the
Huntingdon Reformatory, but which has no effective power to carry
its plans into execution. There is, accordingly, no uniform policy,
even in the case of institutions like the two Glen Mills schools, which
have a similar type of inmates and an identical aim, nor in the case
of all the institutions under consideration in matters where their
problems and needs are the same. That there are advantages in
this policy of separate control cannot be denied. It gives to an energetic
and progressive superintendent or board of managers a degree
of initiative in reform and experimentation which, under a highly
centralized control of all the institutions, it would be difficult to
secure. On the other hand it may have the effect of depriving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
individual institution, because of its poverty or because of the
reactionary character of its administration, of the benefits of an
advance which may have been made elsewhere. There could not
be a better illustration of the unevenness of development resulting
from this lack of co-ordination in the Pennsylvania prison system
than the fact that the Eastern Penitentiary was compelled to wait
for the initiative of its present Warden for the partial adoption
of the congregate system, which had for forty years existed in
the Western Penitentiary, and which had everywhere demonstrated
its superiority over the system of solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, however, what strikes the thoughtful observer
is not the diversity of policy and management among these institutions,
even where they have avowedly different aims, but their
conformity to a common type, and that the prison type. With only
two exceptions&mdash;Sleighton Farms and the Training School at Morganza&mdash;the
persistent shadow of the Penitentiary rests upon them all.
It is true that in the new Central Penitentiary on its broad acreage
at Bellefonte and in the Eastern Penitentiary, so far as the physical
and industrial conditions render possible, the shadow has been
lifted, but it is safe to say of the penal system of the State as a whole,
that it is still too much dominated by the ancient ideal of demonstrating
to the inmates that “the way of the transgressor is hard.”
Even in institutions of a purely reformatory character, while they
leave little to be desired in the way of healthful conditions of living,
orderly administration and educational opportunities, the reformation
of the wrong-doer is still too much sought through a system of
stern repression, of “iron discipline”&mdash;a system which, as all experience
shows, defeats its end by crushing out the finer elements of
character on which the redemption of the individual must depend.
An almost invariable incident of this type of disciplinary control
is the persistence of the policy of securing good conduct through
punishment&mdash;often severe punishment for trivial offenses&mdash;rather
than by the more enlightened and humane method of holding out
incentives to good behavior, either by the grant of special privileges
or by putting on the inmates themselves the responsibility for the
good behavior of all.</p>

<p>Other instances of the persistence of the traditional attitude
toward the offender are the almost complete lack throughout our
penal system of a scientific, balanced ration, such as has in the
experience of prison administrators in other States, as notably at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Sing Sing Prison in 1916, and more recently in our army camps,
demonstrated the value both for health and efficiency and from the
point of view of economy of a scientific management of the problem
of food supply for large masses of men; the general indifference to
outdoor recreation and exercise, so essential to the health and morale
of the inmate body; the meagre provision for any education worthy of
the name; the all but complete lack of comprehensive and well
rounded systems of vocational or industrial training, on which the
efficiency of prison labor and the ability of the inmates to “make
good” in the world of industry after their release so largely depends;
the demoralizing idleness which is still after three decades of effort
the most marked characteristic of our prison system; and, finally,
the insufficient care for the physical and mental health of the inmates
of our correctional institutions, which still for the most part mingle
indiscriminately together the tuberculous and syphilitic with those
who are sound in body and the insane, psychopathic and defective
with those who are sound in mind.</p>

<p>Many of these conditions which continue to put the brand of the
prison on the inmates of our correctional institutions are doubtless
due to the survival of the Bastille type of prison architecture, which
is exemplified in the Eastern and Western Penitentiaries and in
such structures as Moyamensing Prison in Philadelphia, the Convict
Prison at Holmesburg, the Philadelphia House of Correction and
many others. It is scarcely too much to say that no human being
is vile enough to deserve confinement in such a place or dangerous
enough to need it. Even the most unbending of the old type of
prison official will concede that 80 per cent. of the inmates neither
need nor deserve to be confined behind triple bars of steel or in cells
like catacombs or within walls like those of Egyptian tombs. Keepers
and inmates alike lose half their humanity by confinement in these
grim and forbidding structures. No reforming influence however
humane and generous, can long survive in their atmosphere.</p>

<p>Public opinion is at last moving away from this antiquated type
of prison architecture to the newer type represented in the honor
prison at New Hampton Farms in New York and in our Commonwealth
in the cottage colonies at Sleighton Farms, Glen Mills, Morganza,
and Muncy. The change which comes over the men who are
transferred from the Western Penitentiary to the new prison site in
Centre County is a sufficient commentary on the older type of prison,
and demonstrates beyond peradventure the duty of affording to all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of our convict population a similar life of freedom and opportunity.
This result, so desirable from every point of view, could in large
measure be attained in a short time by equipping the Eastern Penitentiary
with a suitable area of farm land in the Eastern Section of
the State and by making immediate provision for the institution of
State industrial farms for the convicts confined in the county prisons,
as is recommended elsewhere in this report.</p>

<h3>IV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Prison Labor.</span></h3>

<p>The conditions existing in the penal institutions of the Commonwealth
with respect to the employment of the inmates in useful
industry have been so fully set forth in the Emergency Report
submitted by the Commission to the Governor in September last
(a copy of which is annexed to this report) and in the comprehensive
study of the problem by the Penal Commission of 1913-1915 (submitted
to the General Assembly under date of February 15, 1915)
that it is not deemed necessary to go into the matter at length in
this place. It suffices to call attention to the fact that the conditions
described in those reports have not in any material respect
been improved. Of approximately 10,000 inmates in the penal
and correctional institutions of the State, less than one-half are
usefully employed, not more than one-fourth in productive labor.
The economic waste of such a system extended over a century is
scarcely less appalling than its inhumanity. By the law a large
part of this interminable procession of offending and suffering
humanity has been condemned to hard labor. In actual practice
nearly all of it has been doomed to wasteful and demoralizing
idleness.</p>

<p>The law of June 1, 1915, “providing a system of employment
and compensation for the inmates of the Eastern Penitentiary,
Western Penitentiary and the Pennsylvania Industrial Reformatory
at Huntingdon” and creating a Prison Labor Commission to carry
its provisions into effect, has proved almost wholly inoperative,
owing primarily to the failure of the Legislature to provide for the
compulsory purchase of prison-made goods by the Commonwealth
or the political divisions thereof or by public institutions. As
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
a consequence, out of a total population of 3200 in the three institutions
to which the authority of the Commission extends, at the
close of the year 1918 only 169 were employed under the direction
of the Commission. These were distributed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whether considered as a relief from the crushing burden of
expense that our penal establishments entail, or as a remedy for the
physical and moral degeneration resulting from enforced idleness,
or as a means to equip the inmates for lives of industry and usefulness
after their release, a system of prison labor which produces
the results set forth in these figures stands self condemned.</p>

<p>To make the plan embodied in the law of 1915 effective, it should
further provide:</p>

<p>(1) That municipalities as well as the Commonwealth and the
political divisions thereof and all public institutions shall be required,
as far as may be practicable, to supply their needs from the
labor of the penal and correctional institutions;</p>

<p>(2) That the authority of the Commission or of any body in
which its powers may be vested shall extend to the reformatory
institutions at Darlington, Glen Mills, Morganza and Muncy and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to all State, county and municipal institutions of a penal or correctional
character;</p>

<p>(3) That the power of such Commission or body to regulate
prison industry be extended to all forms of labor activity of the
inmates of such institutions, including farming, roadmaking, land
reclamation, forestry, etc.;</p>

<p>(4) That such Commission or body be empowered to determine
the compensation of prisoners for industrial and other work performed
by them and the method of applying such compensation to
the use of such prisoners or their dependents;</p>

<p>(5) That the strict “State use” plan be modified by permitting
the sale in the open market, at not less than the market price, of any
surplus product resulting from the labor of the inmates over and
above the product disposed of as provided in the act.</p>

<h3 id="COUNTY_PRISONS">V.<br />

<span class="smcap">The County Prisons.</span></h3>

<p>In Pennsylvania, as in most, if not all, of the other States of
the Union, the county jail is the despair of those who look for a
better day in the treatment of the wrong-doer. The admiration
which our experiments in the reformatory treatment of the young
have excited in eminent foreign penologists has turned to loathing
when their attention was directed to the county jails. Sir Evelyn
Ruggles-Brise, the distinguished head of the English prison system,
in an article published a few months after his visit to this country
in 1910, described them in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In these gaols it is hardly too much to say that many
of the features linger which called forth the wrath and indignation
of the great Howard at the end of the eighteenth
century. Promiscuity, unsanitary conditions, absence of
supervision, idleness and corruption&mdash;these remain the features
in many places. Even the ‘fee’ system is still in vogue.
The gaolers are still paid by fees for the support of prisoners,
and commitments to gaol are common when some other
disposition of the case would have been imposed had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
the commitment yielded a fee to the sheriff, who is usually
in charge of the gaol. In many gaols there are not facilities
for medical examination on reception, for ventilation, for
exercise, or for bathing<span class="nowrap">....</span> The foreign delegates
were amazed at this startling inconsistency between the
management of the common gaols and that of the State
prisons and State reformatories. The evils to which I refer
are well known and deplored by that body of earnest and
devoted men and women in all sections of American society
with whose lofty ideals on the subject of prison reform and
generous aspirations for the humane treatment of the prisoner,
the Washington Congress made us every day familiar, but
they seem helpless and almost hopeless<span class="nowrap">....</span> I was
appealed to by leading men in more than one State, as British
representative, to publicly condemn the system, and this I
did, at a risk of giving considerable offense. Until the
abuses of the gaol system are removed, it is impossible for
America to have assigned to her by general consent a place
in the vanguard of progress in the domain of ‘<i>la science
penitentiaire</i>.’”</p></blockquote>

<p>Your Commission desires to submit as its considered judgment
that the foregoing statement does no injustice to many of the county
prisons of this Commonwealth, and that the Legislature can do no
greater service, nor one that will reflect more credit on the Commonwealth,
than to sweep away the entire county jail system without
delay.</p>

<p>Attention has been called elsewhere in this report to the deplorable
conditions of idleness which prevail in the prisons of our
Commonwealth. These conditions are at their worst in the county
institutions. In the last six years the average daily number of
prisoners in the county jails of the Commonwealth has been about
6500. Only about one-fourth of these have some form of employment
other than domestic service. But when all of the returns
are in with regard to the work accomplished, the number of days
spent in complete idleness in the course of a year will average more
than one million. If we regard the labor of the prisoners as worth
fifty cents a day, the amount of waste thus exceeds $500,000 annually.</p>

<p>In order to obviate this condition of affairs, the General Assembly
in 1917 passed an Act (No. 337, P. L. 1917), vesting in the officers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
in charge of county prisons the privilege of allowing the prisoners
to work on county and poorhouse farms. Although only twenty-seven
counties have taken advantage of this Act, its results have
been very beneficial. The workers have improved in health,
strength and morale, and the produce of their labor has been of
material help in the up-keep of the institutions. Unfortunately,
the operation of this Act terminates with the close of the war.</p>

<p>A more comprehensive Act was proposed by the Penal Commission
of 1913-1915, which recommended the establishment of six
industrial farms to be controlled by the State, to which all persons
convicted of crime or misdemeanor, and now committed to county
institutions, should hereafter be sent. This admirable measure
was, however, amended in such a way as to leave the initiative in
the creation of such farms and the control thereof to the County
Commissioners of the nine groups of counties into which the State
was divided for the purpose (No. 399, P. L. 1917). This legislation
has fallen flat, not one of the industrial districts having carried
the scheme into effect.</p>

<p>Your Commission submits that there is no remedy for the condition
of affairs above described other than the complete assumption
by the State of the custody and care of the offenders, whether felons
or misdemeanants, who are now committed to the county institutions.</p>

<p>Farming for prisoners, as our investigations in other States
have clearly shown, has passed beyond the experimental stage.
The State of Massachusetts, some years ago, established a penal
farm for misdemeanants at Bridgewater. A large tract of ground
was purchased, consisting largely of swamp and abandoned land,
which, by the use of fertilizers and by drainage, has been brought
to a high degree of cultivation. This enterprise has been so signally
successful that it is now proposed to move the State Prison at
Charlestown to this same farm at Bridgewater.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most successful experiment of the kind has been
made in Indiana, where the State has taken over the custody of
misdemeanants on the plan which was recommended by the Pennsylvania
Penal Commission of 1913-1915, a recommendation which
is renewed in this report. The Superintendent of the Indiana State
Farm makes the following report:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The farm had an average daily population, in 1918, of
four hundred and sixty-two prisoners. All institution buildings
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
and outbuildings, the sewer system, power plant, heating
and water systems, land reclaiming, farming and gardening,
has been done with the labor of misdemeanants at a surprisingly
low cost for guards. The Indiana State Farm is
allowed fifty-five cents per man per day for its entire maintenance,
while the same man in jail, at the present time, will
cost more than one dollar per day for the gross maintenance.
The fifty-five cents per man per day pays the entire pay roll,
subsistence, fuel, light, heat, medical services, clothing, transportation,
field and garden seeds, fertilizers, common labor,
tools and all other items of maintenance<span class="nowrap">....</span></p>

<p>“The effect that the Indiana State Farm has had on the
jail system of the State is indicated by the following figures:
In the year 1914 there were 18,130 commitments to county
jails, in 1915, 14,644, and in 1916, 9,896. The doors of the
State Farm were opened April 12, 1915, and the full effect
of the State Farm was not noticeable until the close of the
year 1916. The moral effect of the institution on the misdemeanant
class was one very important factor in reducing
the jail commitments.”</p></blockquote>

<p>During the year ending September 30, 1918, this penal farm
was two-thirds self-supporting, and it is confidently expected that
the institution will soon be entirely self-supporting.</p>

<p>New York City has established a reformatory farm of 630 acres
at New Hampton, N. Y., to which boys and men from sixteen to
thirty years of age are committed. They have no bars, no wall, no
restraining thing, except supervision. They have no cell for punishment.
From the farm they secure most of their provisions. In
handling 2000 prisoners, they have lost only five. The
health of the inmates is greatly improved. It is estimated that
45 per cent. of the prisoners there were addicted to the drug
habit. Most of them were sent away restored. What they needed
was to be built up by fresh air, good food and exercise, and to be
employed in wholesome work. In fact, they have been taught the
dignity of labor&mdash;a thing to which most of them had hitherto been
strangers.</p>

<p>But we need not go beyond the limits of our own State to prove
the benefit and success of farming for misdemeanants. The administration
of the Allegheny County Workhouse illustrates the economy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
of providing employment for prisoners on an industrial farm. Here
the average daily number of inmates in 1918 was 722. The daily
average cost of each inmate was 81 cents, but after deducting the
earnings of the inmates, the net cost was only 32 cents. This means
that the inmates earned 49 cents a day toward their own maintenance.
Their bookkeeping indicates merely the cost of raising the
crops. If the institution had charged itself with the produce used
by it at the prevailing market price, the net cost would have been
much less. The farm has 670 acres, of which 560 acres are farmed
and used as pasture. The inmates are continually coming and going.
Many of them are committed for ten days or less, and a large part
are sentenced for 30 days, while comparatively few of them remain
longer than one year. This shows that a great deal of efficient work
can be secured, even from those who serve for short terms.</p>

<p>A similarly striking result has been attained in Delaware County
under the law of 1911, empowering the judges of the Courts of
Common Pleas to release on parole convicts confined in county jails
or workhouses under the supervision of designated probation officers.
Acting under this law, the President Judge of that county has during
the year 1918 paroled a number of inmates of the county jail to work
on farm lands rented for the purpose with the remarkable result that
only two of the men so paroled made their escape (both being afterwards
retaken) and that nearly $14,000 worth of crops were sold
for cash in addition to the vegetables used and stored in the prison.
The net profit is estimated at $7,000.</p>

<p>Logically, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the State ought
to assume the care of all offenders. The laws are made by the State,
and the indictments charge the accused with offences against the
“peace and dignity of the Commonwealth,” not against the peace
and dignity of the county, municipality or borough. The conclusion
is inevitable that the Commonwealth should assume the
responsibility for the protection of the community from both felons
and misdemeanants. And since such an arrangement as has been
proposed will result in reduced taxation, uniformity of management
and in greater facilities for the education and reformation
of the delinquent, we feel that the establishment of State industrial
farms to receive the delinquents now committed to the county prisons
should receive your favorable consideration.</p>

<p>The bill submitted to carry this recommendation into effect omits
the counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny from its operation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Allegheny County already has a prison farm which in many ways
may be considered a model of its kind. Philadelphia has a farm in
connection with the House of Correction which furnishes employment
to many prisoners and supplies much produce for the institution.
We recommend that at some early date the City of Philadelphia
may, by the purchase of more land, extend the advantages of
a penal farm to its convict prison and in some way combine under
one management the entire penal system of the municipality.</p>

<p>The fee system, whereby the sheriff or warden receives a stipulated
sum each day for the board of prisoners, is so liable to abuse
that we submit a proposition to abolish the practice in all our prisons.
Whenever the profits from boarding the prisoners is a part of the
remuneration of the officer in charge, the tendency is doubtless to
exploit the prisoners, or to reduce to a minimum the supply of food,
in order to derive the greater profit.</p>

<p>In 1915 a comprehensive study of the cost of boarding the
prisoners in the largest 25 counties of the Commonwealth indicated
that the average daily cost of food per prisoner in the 15 prisons
where the food was purchased on the contract system was 12 cents,
and in the 10 counties where the fee system was in vogue 33.7 cents,
the difference in favor of the contract system being 21.7 cents per
day for each prisoner.</p>

<p>We estimate that in these 10 counties alone the saving to the
taxpayers by the adoption of the contract system will be at least
$50,000 annually. The economy of the proposition is evident,
making due allowance for providing in some counties additional
compensation for the official in charge of the prison. In all cases
where a change has been made from the fee system to the contract
system, the food has improved in character, thus tending to the
betterment of the health and morale of the inmates.</p>

<p>Moved by these considerations, the General Assembly in 1909
provided that in all counties having a population of 150,000 or more,
the food for the prisoners must be purchased by contract. We are
now proposing to extend this principle to all the counties of the
Commonwealth, with the understanding that no such change is to
take place during the incumbency of the officials who are at the
present time in charge of the prisons.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<h3>VI.<br />

<span id="PROBATION_AND_PAROLE" class="smcap">Probation and Parole.</span></h3>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Under the law of May 10, 1909, the several courts of
criminal jurisdiction are invested with the power of suspending
sentence on certain classes of convicted offenders and of placing
such offenders on probation instead of committing them for definite
or indeterminate periods of imprisonment. Probation officers,
charged with the duty of supervising the behavior of such probationers,
are appointed by the judges to serve in their respective
counties. In this Commonwealth, as in many others, experience has
demonstrated that there is little uniformity in the practice of the
courts in suspending sentence or of the probation officers in exercising
their powers.</p>

<p>Conceived as a mere incident of the sentencing power, to be
exercised only in exceptional cases, the suspended sentence and
probation are beginning to disclose themselves as a momentous,
not to say revolutionary step in the progress of penology, not less
important in its ultimate consequences than the substitution a
century ago of imprisonment for the death penalty and other forms
of physical punishment. Like the older forms of punishment which
it superseded, imprisonment too has proved a failure, so far at least,
as the newer aim of punishment, the reformation of the wrong-doer
is concerned. And we are coming to see that the protection which
society enjoys through the imprisonment for a few months or years of
a small proportion of the criminal class is dearly purchased by a
system which returns the offender to society less fitted than before
to cope with the conditions of a life of freedom. More and more,
as we develop a probation service worthy of the name, will the courts
be reluctant to commit men, women and children to the demoralizing
associations and discipline of institutional life and will give them
their chance to redeem themselves under competent guidance and
supervision among the associations and activities of everyday life.</p>

<p>Even under existing conditions it is safe to say that far too many
adult and youthful offenders convicted of criminal offences are
committed to prison and far too many delinquent children to reformatories
and other correctional institutions. Your Commission believes
that the suspended sentence should be more liberally employed by
the courts of the Commonwealth under strict conditions requiring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
a life of useful industry under careful supervision; that children
under 12 years of age should never be committed to penal or
correctional institutions but rather, where institutional care is
deemed necessary, to parental schools such as have been established
in other States as a part of the regular educational system; and that
children of larger growth, say from 12 to 16, should, wherever
possible, be placed on probation or put under private guardianship.</p>

<p>Those considerations have led the Commission to the conclusion
that the whole subject of the suspended sentence and probation in
this Commonwealth should be thoroughly studied in order that the
principles that should govern it may be carefully defined and its
procedure worked out, supervised and put on a uniform basis. New
York and other States have for this purpose created a permanent
probation board or commission and the success which has attended
their labors suggests the institution of a similar body in this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The indeterminate sentence, which made its appearance in
this Commonwealth in the law of May 10, 1909, has passed through
several phases to a state in which its purpose is almost completely
defeated. In its original form it provided that the maximum term
to be imposed upon a convict who should be sentenced to imprisonment
in either the Eastern or the Western Penitentiaries should not
exceed the maximum time prescribed by law and that the minimum
term when not fixed by law, should not exceed one-fourth of the
maximum time. This law was amended by an Act approved June 19,
1911, striking out the restriction as to the minimum sentence, thus
leaving to the courts complete discretion to fix the minimum to be
served at any period short of the maximum. Many of the courts
have in frequent instances virtually nullified the indeterminate
sentence principle by imposing minimum sentences so excessive as
to bring the judicial office into disrepute. Sentences of from 18 years
to 20 and from 19 years to 20 have been common, and there have
been cases so grotesque as sentences of 19 years 11 months, or of
19 years, 11 months and 29 days to 20 years, of 23 years and 3 months
to 25 years and of 27 to 28 years. These are only the more extreme
illustrations of a practice which has been common enough to justify
a demand for a law which will result in greater uniformity in the
matter of imposing sentences for crime.</p>

<p>At its best the maximum-minimum form of the indeterminate
sentence is an unsatisfactory compromise between the ideal aim of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
penologists and the traditional attitude of the courts, which cling
tenaciously to their ancient prerogative of “making the punishment
fit the crime.” That the power of determining the period of imprisonment
requisite to meet the demands of justice and the interests of
society may safely be confided to other than judicial hands has been
conceded in the case of all offenders entitled to commitment to
reformatories, who are sentenced to an indeterminate term limited
only by the maximum fixed by law, or, in the case of minors, to the
attainment of their majority, and who may be released on parole in
the discretion of the boards of managers of the institutions to which
they are committed. It is only in the case of hardened offenders or
of those guilty of certain major offenses that a minimum sentence is
imposed.</p>

<p>For more than a generation prison reformers have urged the
extension of the pure indeterminate sentence to this class of offenders
also. Their logic is sound; it is the facts that are against them. The
argument runs like this: The offender should be kept in confinement
only until he is fitted by his prison experience to lead an honest
and useful life; when this end is attained he should be released. The
answer is that the prison doesn’t in fact reform the wrong-doer;
that good behavior under the conditions of prison life is no assurance
of the intention or capacity of the prisoner to lead an honest and
useful life after his release, and that the inspectors or other paroling
authority have no other guide to go by in determining the inmates’
fitness for a life of freedom than his prison record. If the reformer
makes the obvious retort&mdash;“then reform your prison so that it shall
reform its inmates, and reform your paroling authority so that it
shall make its determination on all the facts of the inmate’s personal
history including a study of his mental conditions, his heredity and
the social influences that have shaped his character,” he is admitting
that we are not yet ready for the complete acceptance of the indeterminate
sentence in all classes of cases.</p>

<p>But there is a middle ground between the position of the extreme
reformer and that which has been assumed by the courts of this
Commonwealth. If there is to be anything short of a fixed sentence,
declared by law, it should be a reasonable minimum which should
also be declared by law. The policy of the indeterminate sentence is
that the delinquent shall be supervised and guided and his capacity
to lead an honest and useful life tested by actual experience under
normal conditions of living for a period of years long enough to try
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
out his capacity to readjust himself to a life of freedom in society.
For this reason an adequate interval between the expiration of his
minimum sentence, when he becomes eligible to parole, and the
expiration of his maximum sentence, when he becomes free from
judicial control, should be guaranteed by law.</p>

<p>There is great diversity of opinion as to the best form of paroling
authority. Generally, as in this Commonwealth, this power is lodged
in the inspectors or managers of the several institutions or, in the
case of commitments to county prisons, in the courts of criminal
jurisdiction. In some States, as in New York, a distinct Board of
Parole is constituted which visits the convict prisons at intervals and
hears and determines all applications for parole that may be awaiting
determination. Neither system has worked with complete satisfaction.
Under both the grant of parole is largely a perfunctory matter,
the inmates who have served their minimum sentences being generally
admitted to parole at once, except in those cases, comparatively rare
in number, where the applicant has been penalized for misconduct
while in confinement. It would seem, therefore, that the first step
toward a reform of the paroling system is not to set up a new paroling
authority but to devise some more effective machinery to put before
the existing authorities all the essential facts as to the applicant’s
mental, moral and physical capacity to conduct himself as a self-respecting,
useful member of the community. A second, but not less
necessary step, is such a change in the spirit and method of prison
discipline as will develop in the inmates by actual practice the
qualities of self-respect and self-reliance, the sense of honor and of
responsibility and the habit of co-operative action so essential to fit
them for a life of freedom and responsibility, and at the same time
to equip them with the habits of industry and the vocational skill
which will enable them to make good in the life that awaits them
beyond the prison-wall.</p>

<h3>VII.<br />

<span class="smcap">General Conclusions.</span></h3>

<p>In the foregoing analysis of the penal system of this Commonwealth,
the Commission has endeavored not only to present a picture
of the existing conditions in the light of modern conceptions of
penology but to point out, also, the lines of a sound and progressive
development of the system. Most of the suggestions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
thus made have already been embodied in the penal systems of other
states and of enlightened communities beyond the seas. Especially
is this the case in such matters as the general employment of the
prison population in useful and productive labor and in the substitution
of farm and cottage colonies for the old type of prison. In a few
of the larger cities and in some institutions promising beginnings have
been made in the mental examination of delinquents with a view to
the provision of specialized treatment for those found to be mentally
afflicted or seriously defective. But in no State or country, as yet,
have all these improvements been welded into a comprehensive
system which makes them available for the entire delinquent population.
The inertia or indifference which leaves the extension of
these benefits to chance or to the slow contagion of example is
unworthy of a great and progressive Commonwealth which has in
the past more than once demonstrated its capacity for leadership
in penal reform.</p>

<p>It is evident that the general adoption in this State of these
modern improvements in the treatment of the criminal problem can
be effected only through the institution of a central agency adapted
to secure a co-ordination of effort and a uniformity of development
which under the present system of separate control has been demonstrated
to be impossible. It seems equally evident, however, that the
system of separate management of the several institutions with their
diverse aims and problems possesses advantages which we would
not willingly sacrifice to an ideal unity. For this reason the Commission
has not deemed it wise to recommend the example of other
States which have committed the management of all their correctional
establishments to a central board of control. Moreover, with
such a body as the Board of Public Charities already vested with
a certain authority over the penal institutions of the State, it has not
been deemed desirable to recommend the creation of a new and
independent body to exercise a new jurisdiction over such institutions.
It seems better to utilize the authority which already exists,
to enlarge its range of functions to meet the needs of the proposed
development and to commit the exercise of these functions to a
standing committee analogous to the existing Committee on Lunacy.
Through such a committee of the Board of Public Charities your
Commission believes that the desired co-ordination and future development
of the penal system of the Commonwealth can best be
secured.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h3>VIII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Recommendations.</span></h3>

<p>Upon the foregoing facts and conclusions the Commission submits
the following recommendations, which are herewith submitted for
such action as the General Assembly may deem proper:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First.</i>&mdash;The Commission recommends that the General Assembly
provide for the enlargement of the Board of Public Charities by the
addition of two members thereto, at least one of whom shall be a
woman, and by the institution of a standing committee of five
members of such Board, at least one of whom shall be a woman,
such committee, which shall be chosen annually by a majority vote
of the Board, to be known as the “Committee on Delinquency” and
to be vested with the following powers:&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) To inspect and investigate the condition and management of
all penal, correctional and reformatory institutions within the
Commonwealth and inquire into all complaints against the same and
report thereon, with recommendations of appropriate action, to the
Board of Public Charities, the Governor, the General Assembly, or
the Courts, as the circumstances may require;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) To institute, maintain and supervise a medical service adapted
to the examination of the inmates of such institutions and the proper
professional treatment of all such as are mentally or physically
afflicted or deficient;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) To make recommendations to the governing authorities of all
such institutions for the improvement of the sanitary and hygienic
conditions, the medical and hospital equipment, and the medical
service thereof;</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) To transfer inmates of institutions within its jurisdiction to
other institutions owned, managed or controlled by the Commonwealth
or any political subdivision thereof, or, if suitable arrangements
can be made, to other institutions, where such inmates may
receive treatment more suitable to their mental and physical condition;</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) To institute, maintain and supervise in institutions within
its jurisdiction a system of correctional and reformatory education;</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) To institute, maintain and supervise a system for the employment
of the inmates of institutions within its jurisdiction;</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) To prepare and submit to the Board of Public Charities not
later than the first day of December of each even-numbered year,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
a biennial budget for the Committee and such of the institutions
within its jurisdiction as are wholly or partly supported by the
Commonwealth, and for that purpose to require of such institutions
such reports from time to time as the Committee shall deem necessary;
and</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) To make rules and regulations establishing a uniform system of
accounting and bookkeeping in all institutions within its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>It is also recommended that the Committee on Delinquency be
authorized and directed to choose a Secretary, not a member of the
Board of Public Charities, at a salary of $7500 per annum, who shall
be the executive officer of the Committee and an expert in the care
and treatment of delinquents, and who shall be known as the “Commissioner
of Delinquency.”</p>

<p><i>Second.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends that the General
Assembly provide by appropriate legislation for the employment of
all the able-bodied convicts of the Commonwealth in useful and, so
far as possible, in productive labor, and especially, that it vest in the
Committee on Delinquency the powers of the Prison Labor Commission
and the functions of the Business Agent of such Commission
and enlarge such powers and functions as suggested on page 15
of this report.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends the enactment of a
law establishing four State Industrial Farms, to receive, care for and
provide for the useful employment of the inmates of county prisons
and jails and of persons hereafter convicted of any offense punishable
by imprisonment in any county jail or prison who have been or
shall hereafter be sentenced for a term of thirty days or more.</p>

<p><i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends that the Act of
Assembly approved July 17, 1917 (No. 337), providing for the employment,
during the continuance of the war, of inmates of county jails
at agricultural labor on any county or almshouse farm, be amended so
as to continue its operation indefinitely after the conclusion of peace.</p>

<p><i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends that the General
Assembly provide for the purchase of a tract of land, of not less than
600 nor more than 1200 acres, to be used for the benefit of the Eastern
Penitentiary as a prison farm.</p>

<p><i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends that a law be
enacted prohibiting fees or allowances and contracts for furnishing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
meals to the inmates of county jails or other penal institutions of
the Commonwealth.</p>

<p><i>Seventh.</i>&mdash;The Commission further recommends that the Act
approved June 19, 1911, authorizing the courts in the case of a person
sentenced to a penitentiary to fix as the minimum term of imprisonment
any period less than the maximum prescribed by law for the
offense of which such person was convicted, be amended by a provision
that the minimum limit of the sentence imposed shall never
exceed one-third of the maximum prescribed by the Court.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the foregoing recommendations the Commission has confined
itself to matters requiring legislative action and to such only as seem
to it to be essential to a consistent, integrated policy of penal administration.
All other matters with respect to which the Commission has
given expression to its views are either subsidiary to those on which
immediate legislative action is recommended or are such as may be
properly referred to the wisdom of the proposed Committee on
Delinquency for consideration and action. The greatest abuse of the
prevailing prison system&mdash;the lack of imagination and of understanding
which keeps alive in most of our penal establishments the
methods of a severe and repressive discipline&mdash;cannot be abolished
by legislative decree. The greatest reform of which the system is
capable&mdash;the awakening in the inmates of the new life which comes
from active, responsible participation in the life of the prison community&mdash;is
equally beyond the reach of legislative action. These
will be the fruits of a keener intelligence and of a deeper understanding
than have yet, except in a few rare instances, been brought to
bear on the problem. But your Commission believes that the plan
of penal administration which it has recommended, and which provides
for the most thorough-going study and the most intelligent
treatment of the individual delinquent which has yet been attempted,
will gradually prepare the way for these and other reforms in the
penal system of the Commonwealth.</p>

<h3 id="AGRICULTURAL_PRISON_LABOR">AGRICULTURAL PRISON LABOR.<br />

<span class="smcap">Harry R. Campbell.</span></h3>

<p>An article prepared for the County Commissioners’ Convention, Pittsburgh,
August 7, 1918.</p>

<p>Agricultural prison labor is strongly advocated by prison authorities
and has been in general use in the penal institutions of Pennsylvania
for many years. The movement for outdoor work for
prisoners has grown rapidly, and as a result, the Pennsylvania
legislature, at its 1917 session, extended the scope of agricultural
work for prisoners, and authorized by an Act approved July 17,
1917, the employment of prisoners, undergoing sentence in county
jails, on county or poor farms.</p>

<p>There is no greater curse than idleness. An unemployed prisoner
is a future menace to society, and no effort should be spared to keep
him busy&mdash;to impress upon him the dignity and necessity of work,
and to make him know that he is stronger physically and better
morally if he is regularly employed.</p>

<p>Prison labor should be approached with a desire to help the
prisoner and restore him to society cured of his criminal ailment.
If the only purpose in the minds of the authorities is to make a
profit for their district, they are in grave danger of reverting to the
old convict labor system, which at best was only a modified form
of slavery.</p>

<p>Agricultural prison labor offers the opportunity of a direct profit
to the district, and places the prisoner in an environment peculiarly
adapted to his own physical and mental betterment. I am informed
that it is used with great success in several counties, including Delaware,
Montgomery, Chester, Berks, Lehigh, Beaver, Bucks, Cambria,
Fayette and Westmoreland.</p>

<p>Another important measure enacted by the Pennsylvania legislature
and approved July 20, 1917, requires the erection of an
Industrial Farm, Workhouse and Reformatory in each of nine
districts created by the Act. Each institution is to be built and
managed by a Board of Trustees, consisting of one County Commissioner
from each county in the district, appointed by the President
Judge of the proper Court.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is the purpose of the institution to keep all persons employed
about the farm and buildings, in growing all kinds of farm produce,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
raising live stock and in manufacturing supplies for its own use,
or for the use of the several counties in the district, or any public or
charitable institution owned or managed by any of the district
counties.</p>

<p>Prisoners may also be employed in the making of brick, tile,
and concrete, or other road building supplies for the use of the
several counties. All material manufactured shall be sold at prices
fixed by the Trustees, preference being given in the sale to the
counties comprising the district, and to the cities, boroughs and
townships therein.</p>

<p>The cost of the site, buildings and additions thereto, and all
fixed overhead charges are to be paid by the counties comprising
the district, in ratio to their population. All moneys received from
the sale of produce or manufactured articles or supplies shall be
credited to the overhead expenses.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is a digest of the law which is designed to inaugurate
agricultural prison labor on a large scale in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Trustees were promptly appointed by the Courts of the
State. The Fourth district, organized in March with the election
of Mr. George W. Deeds, of Westmoreland County, as president.
This board has been actively engaged in inspecting proposed sites,
a number of which have been offered, but no selection has, as yet,
been made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another phase of prison labor that must be taken into full consideration
in the establishment of industrial farms, is the attitude
of the Courts in reference to the parole law now in effect. If the
Judges believe that the ends of justice are best served by paroling
convicts, rather than committing them to some institution, the
necessary capacity of the proposed buildings would be materially
affected. In most of the counties but little has been done toward a
general use of the parole law, but in a few of them the Courts are
evidently giving it a trial.</p>

<p>The parole law is regarded with especial favor in Washington
County, where the Courts have at the present time, 672 prisoners
under parole. Every one of this number is employed in the county
and must report monthly to the parole officer, who is also the Court’s
employment agent, and who places every paroled prisoner in a job
suitable to his ability and inclination.</p>

<p>This might be called another phase of prison labor, as industry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
is one of the conditions of the parole, and the labor is done by the
paroled prisoners for their own profit and advancement&mdash;with
freedom to enjoy their homes and pursue their own inclinations
after working hours. So far has the system been carried, that the
Court House, once cleaned entirely by prison labor, is now necessarily
cared for by a paid force of men outside the draft age. You may
better understand why the Court is going to this apparent extreme,
when you know that practically every industry in Washington
County is engaged in war work, and that these paroled men are
placed on farms, and in mines, mills and factories, where they are
helping win the war, though only a small percentage of them are
American citizens and very few are native born.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent. of these men are faithfully complying with
all the conditions of their paroles, 95 per cent. are paying in monthly
installments, the fine and costs imposed upon them by the Court,
and less than five per cent. are proving themselves unworthy of
the confidence reposed in them.</p>

<p>Clearfield County has 10 paroled prisoners; Clinton, 25; Indiana
40; Lycoming, 8; Lehigh, 104; Center, 6; McKean, 47; Butler,
35; and Somerset, 64. It is doubtful if the entire number in all
the other counties in the State would equal the number paroled in
Washington County.</p>

<p>Montgomery County has taken a unique step in the employment
of prison labor and uses the 80 inmates of its county jail in knitting
socks, on knitting machines, for the Red Cross. Many other counties
employ their prisoners, in their jails, in useful occupations.</p>

<p>Agricultural prison labor has been tried out in many States with
gratifying success. Down in Alabama there are 325 men at work
on State farms, where they raised 2300 bushels of wheat last year,
which is an excellent record for a section where wheat is not supposed
to grow. Convicts down there are also worked in the Alabama coal
mines, and are producing 4500 tons of coal daily. Their farm prison
labor is not satisfactory, but in the mines it is pronounced superior
to free labor.</p>

<p>Nebraska is using agricultural prison labor in a small way outside
State institutions and is meeting with splendid success. Maryland
is having the same experience with about 75 convicts who are
helping to relieve the farm labor shortage. Georgia’s male convicts
are employed on the public roads, and the women prisoners are now
engaged in light farm work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>Michigan is farming 4000 acres, but still found sufficient prison
labor to help the farmers with their harvest last year. Wisconsin
has about 100 prison labor farmers and is of the opinion that their
work is as productive as free labor.</p>

<p>New Hampshire objects to agricultural prison labor because it
gives the prisoners no winter employment, and continuous work
is regarded as desirable. Mississippi is meeting with good success
on her State controlled farms, but the law does not permit the use
of prison labor except at State institutions.</p>

<p>Massachusetts is utilizing prison labor on farms, to relieve the
scarcity of farm labor caused by the war, successfully employing
about 100 for that purpose. They regard convict labor, properly
directed, as efficient as free labor.</p>

<p>Vermont believes that its present experience justifies a more
extended use of agricultural prison labor.</p>

<p>Kansas uses its prison labor mostly in prison coal mines, but
is diverting some of its convicts to help the farmers during the war.
Six hundred convicts are employed in Florida on State owned farms.
They are meeting with great success and their prison labor is in
considerable demand. Tennessee has a number of convicts employed
in agricultural labor. The men have gained in health and
earned a profit for the State.</p>

<p>Connecticut uses her prison labor on roads and farms. They
think it is better and more efficient than available free farm labor,
and the farmers of the State are well satisfied with the results
obtained.</p>

<p>Minnesota uses prison labor on roads, and is conducting State
agricultural farms with success. Nevada uses prison labor to harvest
crops on shares. They report the cost disappointing and think
their best results are obtained with agricultural prison labor on
State farms. Virginia uses its prison labor for grinding agricultural
lime for fertilizer. The State employs about 250 convicts on its
own farm, in agricultural work, and finds the work beneficial to
the prisoner as well as to the State.</p>

<p>Illinois is making a special effort to utilize its prison labor, not
only to relieve the scarcity of farm workers, but to help in all other
war industries. About 100 men have been paroled especially for
farm labor, and 350 are successfully employed in factories where
equipment for the government is being manufactured.</p>

<p>The great war has brought forth one outstanding fact in criminology&mdash;no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
matter what his instincts may be in times of peace,
the convict is a patriot, according to his lights, in time of war, and
in all my investigations, covering practically every eastern, southern
and middle western State, I have not learned of a single prisoner
who violated a parole given him to engage in work that would help
win the war.</p>

<p>Iowa is operating nearly 3000 acres by agricultural prison labor,
and is making a wonderful success, not only from a financial viewpoint
but also in fitting the convicts to regain their place in society.</p>

<p>Indiana has done wonders with prison labor along agricultural
lines, having established one large Industrial Farm for misdemeanants.
In addition, the State is utilizing its prisoners to a considerable
extent to relieve the scarcity of farm labor caused by the war.
About 100 convicts built sidings to coal mines to get out fuel for the
war. At the time of a disastrous flood they worked day and night,
without guards, saving by their efforts thousands of dollars worth of
private property. They were also successfully used at the time of
a severe tornado, recovering the lost, and clearing away the debris.
Indiana does not favor the use of prison labor on public roads.</p>

<p>North Carolina is working 500 prisoners on State owned farms
with excellent success, and in addition is helping out the farmers
to some extent. The State also employs about 100 men on the
highways, but believes road work by prison labor is good for the
roads but bad for the men.</p>

<p>New York thinks that every available prisoner should be employed,
but because of constitutional limitation cannot use its
convicts on private farms. Practically every penitentiary and
county jail in the State is employing its prisoners either at gardening
or farm work on State or county owned or leased farms. Food
production has been materially increased by these concerted efforts
towards agricultural products, and the prisoners themselves are
benefited by the outdoor work. Prison labor is also extensively
used on the public roads.</p>

<p>A notable example of the successful employment of agricultural
prison labor, that is coming into more than local prominence, is in
our own State of Pennsylvania, where Warden Francies is working
wonders with his advanced methods at the new penitentiary at
Bellefonte.</p>

<h3 id="FINANCIAL_ARGUMENT_FOR_PRISON_FARMS">THE FINANCIAL ARGUMENT FOR A COUNTY
PRISON FARM.</h3>

<p>It will be generally granted that useful employment in the open
air will be beneficial, but let us also consider the financial side of
the proposition. It will be remembered that the General Assembly
of 1917 passed a bill providing for the establishment of nine Industrial
Farms, to which convicts usually sent to the county jails may be
sent for discipline and employment. I am indebted to Mr. Harry
J. Campbell, of Washington, Pa., for some statistics from nine
counties in the southwestern part of the Commonwealth, constituting
one of the Districts in which an Industrial Prison was to be located.
In order to determine whether such a Prison Farm would be remunerative,
Mr. Campbell collected the statistics from these nine
counties which afford fairly conclusive proof of the economy of the
proposition.</p>

<p>If a Prison Farm were established, they would send none to the
Allegheny County Workhouse.</p>

<p>It is estimated they would send to this farm one-fourth of those
sent to the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>They would send to the Farm one-tenth of those sent to Morganza.</p>

<p>Likewise, one-third of the number sent to the Reformatory

<p>The number of prisoners held for trial at the County Jail varies
from one-tenth to one-half of the whole number imprisoned. However,
we will estimate those convicted at one-half of the number.
Hence, to this Penal Agricultural Institution a minimum number of
587 may be sent, according to the last available statistics.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>This balance would go far toward meeting the expense of purchasing
and stocking the farm and providing the temporary buildings
which may be constructed by the prisoners themselves. The saving
to these counties in two or three years would suffice to purchase
and equip the plant, and with efficient management, the Penal
Farm ought soon to be self-supporting&mdash;a result not only satisfactory
to taxpayers but, what is far more important, in the highest degree
beneficial to the delinquent in whose restoration the community is
vitally interested.</p>

<p>These facts have been gleaned from a study of nine counties,
but it must be remembered that the bill now before the General
Assembly provides for the establishment of such an Institution by
almost double the number of counties, hence it is apparent that
within two or three years the entire expense of the farm and its
equipment will be returned to the managers and with self-support
practically assured, the future expense of caring for such delinquents
will be reduced to a minimum or will entirely vanish.</p>

<h3 id="BOARD_OF_PUBLIC_CHARITIES_AND_PRISON_LABOR">STATE BOARD OF PUBLIC CHARITIES AND
PRISON LABOR.</h3>

<p>We gladly present the following facts which have been gleaned
from interviews with Edward Wilson, Esq., one of the agents of
this Board.</p>

<p>So far as prison labor is involved, the Board of Public Charities
has been deeply interested in developing the possibilities of an Act
which on their initiative was passed and approved in 1917. This
allows the employment of prisoners on lands belonging to any county.</p>

<p>In 1915 Judge Isaac Johnson, in Delaware County began a
system of employing prisoners which the Board desires to extend.
In the year 1918, the receipts from the crops produced by the labor
of prisoners amounted to $14,000, in addition to a large amount of
vegetable products consumed at the prison. The net profit is near
$7000. Report comes that Berks County will be able to supply
the prison with vegetables for the winter. Northampton County
employed fifteen to twenty prisoners on a small farm recently purchased.
Dauphin County had a few prisoners at work on the almshouse
farm. In Montgomery County from fifteen to twenty prisoners
have been employed on the Poor farm. In Columbia County
seven Italians are engaged in operating a war garden which it is
said has been very profitable. In one or two counties with large
population, there is no land available for such purpose. Mr. Wilson
states that little or nothing has been accomplished in this direction
in those counties whose jail population is small. At one time
in the year 1918, there were 13 counties without a prisoner. In
some counties prisoners have worked on the roads. A few counties
have been willing for selected prisoners to be paroled to farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson is inclined to the belief that in some of our counties,
the prevailing type of prisoner is too vicious to be allowed the
freedom which belongs to the cultivation of the soil. From observations
elsewhere we are inclined to the belief that the vilest man
or woman, unless defective in mentality, will respond when treated
with kindness and made to feel that he or she is trusted. Granted,
however, that it may be considered unwise to send all prisoners
without reservation to work on the farm, under the system proposed
by the Commission to investigate Prison Systems, and whose Report
to the General Assembly is found elsewhere in this number of the
Journal, all the State Industrial Prison Farms are to foster some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
industry or industries aside from the horticultural and agricultural
employments. On these farms there will be found opportunity for
the employment of all prisoners, whatever may be their character
or temperament.</p>

<p>Last year in a casual inspection of the prison at Wilkes-Barre,
the secretary announced that he considered 46 out of the 75 prisoners
would be available for an Industrial Farm. Mr. Wilson after a
very careful study of the situation concluded that 11 could be sent
to work on the outside. Now something depends on the viewpoint.
If the State should own an Industrial Farm fully equipped for the
permanent accommodation of prisoners with diverse industries, Mr.
Wilson probably would add materially to the number which might
be sentenced to the penal farm instead of to the county prison
affording so little opportunity for continuous profitable labor. The
secretary consents to some reduction of his estimates, if real employment
with some remuneration can be supplied at the county
jail. The tendency of this practical age is to give regular employment
to all those whom we for a time exclude from community
freedom, and to place over them officials who will direct these
industries.</p>

<h3 id="HOME_OF_INDUSTRY">HOME OF INDUSTRY.</h3>

<p>This Institution which we allowed some 30 years ago to
pass beyond our control, perhaps to its advantage, has just issued
a Report of its work for the year 1918. There was some honest
difference of opinion in 1890 as to the value of this enterprise, but
we believe the principal reason for the abandonment of the project
by The Pennsylvania Prison Society was the lion in the way in
the shape of a financial bugaboo.</p>

<p>During the last year this institution cared for 275 men, keeping
them on an average of 32 days for each man. Their industries
have contributed $9,422 toward its own support.</p>

<p>We have always thought that the institution should be removed
to a farm. In 1917 some of the men did work on land which
they secured and the results were very favorable. In 1918 they
entered upon the same work with high expectations, but from a
variety of causes the agricultural operations have not been prosperous.
Labor went elsewhere. We hope for better results next year.</p>

<p>We recommend this Home as worthy of continued support.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<h3 id="MILITARY_DISCIPLINE_AND_PUNISHMENTS">MILITARY DISCIPLINE AND PUNISHMENTS.</h3>

<p>The Committee on Public Information acting under the authority
of the United States Government have from time to time published
and issued pamphlets giving some extremely valuable facts and
explanations with regard to the Great War and dealing with its
causes and results. Not the least valuable among these circulars is
No. 113, issued March, 1918, and devoted to “German Militarism
and its German Critics.” This handbook contains forty pages and
is compiled from sources which the Government regards as sufficiently
reliable to justify extensive circulation. It may be obtained
by any one who will send request, and refer to it by title, from the
Committee on Public Information, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>From this document we quote a few instances of brutality which
have been presented by credible witnesses:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. “A Polish recruit was maltreated so fearfully by an
officer that he finally hanged himself. The officer induced
the soldiers to certify that they had seen nothing.</p>

<p>2. “An officer struck a sick recruit repeatedly on the
chest so that he screamed with pain and soon thereafter
died in a hospital.</p>

<p>4. “Soldiers were struck in the face during instruction.
<span class="nowrap">...</span> Witness saw hundreds of times helmets pressed
down and the bands which held them under the chin pulled
so that the soldiers grew red in the face. Alsatians and
Lorrainers particularly were maltreated and frequently
called ‘French Skulls’ and worse. The officers warned the
men against complaining, promising worse treatment if they
dared to report these outrages.</p>

<p>5. “During the maneuvers no day passed without
brutality<span class="nowrap">....</span> Boxing of ears, blows, even with the
sword and riding-whip, were daily occurrences<span class="nowrap">....</span>
Complaints were omitted for fear of the consequences.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Enough. In the circular it is stated that at a certain military
trial in Germany, held in 1914, 922 men from all parts of Germany
had signified their willingness to give testimony and were ready to
report some 30,000 separate instances of brutal treatment of soldiers.</p>

<p>Hence it seems apparent that the spirit of dominant militarism is
arrogant, ferocious, brutal. It harks back to the time of medieval
tortures. By the circulation of Tract No. 113, the Government of
the United States has indicated its abhorrence and utter condemnation
of such cruel and inhuman methods of enforcing discipline.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Naturally we expected that our army officials would not for a moment
countenance such arbitrary and tyrannical treatment of offenders.</p>

<p>When we take into consideration the inexperience of this nation
with large armies, there is cause for congratulation that the instances
of cruelty and unwarranted severity have been proportionately so
few. And yet there have been some instances of pitiless malevolence
inflicted upon a class of offenders who least deserve it. We are
aware of the penalties for disobedience to orders which naturally
belong to a military system. In accordance with the military code,
disobedience is a heinous crime. So when the officials were confronted
with refusal to obey orders, even though the offenders were
of the highest character, the mind of the militarist could view the
offense from only one angle. We are referring to the treatment
accorded to some&mdash;not all&mdash;of the “conscientious objectors.” They
constituted an exceedingly small proportion of the American Army
which at the time the armistice was signed numbered 3,665,000.
The number altogether of those conscripted whose religious convictions
forbade them to use carnal weapons was about 3,900&mdash;less
than one-ninth of one per cent. of the vast American Army.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Of
these 1,300 accepted non-combatant service and 1,500 were allowed
to be employed on farms or to aid France and Belgium in the work
of reconstruction of their ruined homes and devastated lands.
Our latest advices inform that 527 of these “conscientious objectors”
have been court-martialed and sent to the Military Prison at Fort
Leavenworth. A majority of these belong to religious bodies whose
creeds are opposed to war. These men were not hunting for trouble.
Conscription brought them from their peaceful homes and from their
farms where they were so much needed to aid in increasing the food
supply of the nation. They were living inoffensively and were
brought into difficulties by no overt act. It is not our intention to
uphold or combat their interpretation of “The Sermon on the
Mount.” They were men who were regarded as useful, upright
members of the communities where they resided. Some of them
belonged to bodies whose members have been foremost in every
philanthropic effort for the last two centuries. We may attach no
special virtue to works of superogation, yet we venture to suggest
that men and women who in times of peace have been foremost in
honest industrial pursuits, who have been prominent in all movements
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to advance the best interests of the community, who have devoted
their time and their means lavishly to social betterment, should in
time of war be entitled to some consideration on account of their
past services in the uplift of humanity. Between the ages of 21 and
31, less than one to every 36,000 were found who claimed immunity
from military service on account of their creed, and as many of these
accepted some form of non-combatant service, the number absolutely
refusing to comply with any military command was less than
one out of 60,000 conscripts. Would it not have been wiser to allow
these men to continue their lawful avocations on the farm, in the
shop, in the mills, than to support them in idleness, to detail a special
force to guard them, and to ruin their health by harsh treatment?</p>

<p>The Hofers case is an authentic instance of an infliction of tortures
by methods which acknowledge no obligation outside of military
authority. Jacob Wipf and the three Hofer brothers were members
of the Huttrian sect, a small body residing in California, “They
believed, with an intense conviction, that their duty to their God
utterly precluded any submission to military command<span class="nowrap">....</span>
It must be remembered that this was no degenerate whim, nor yet
the stubbornness of criminals&mdash;it was the highest spiritual conviction
of deeply religious men.” They refused to wear the uniform. A
mere outline of the penalties will suffice. Thrown into the “Hole,”
30 feet below the base of the building at the level of the sea. Murky
atmosphere. Stripped to underwear. Handcuffed to an iron bar
so that their feet barely reached the floor. Remained strung up
for 36 hours. No food; one glass of water. Repeatedly beaten
with clubs. Then for five days exempted from “hanging up,”
but confined without food, or sufficient clothing. The authorities
were finally broken, not these God-fearing men. It seems like a
tale from the “Book of Martyrs,” not an event in a civilized nation.
They were released from the dungeon broken in health, afflicted
with scurvy, and after suffering a lot of petty persecutions, were
transferred to another prison in a colder climate. Here they were
placed in “Solitary,” with diet of bread and water, strung up for
nine hours a day, forced to sleep on the floor. The cold draughts had
a natural effect. When it was learned that they were ill, they were
removed to a hospital where two of them died in a few days from
pneumonia. The surviving brother, though scarcely able to walk,
was mercifully released to accompany the dead bodies of the two
brothers to their homes. Military vengeance was satiated. It is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
incredible to believe that such methods in this enlightened age are
used.</p>

<p>From the New York World, we note the following instances of
treatment accorded to “objectors” at Camp Funston. Sleeping
on bare floor. No food all day. Kicked repeatedly. Beaten with
rifle butts, pricked with bayonets, dragged over filth, choked till
they are breathless, placed under a cold shower at midnight, clothes
and all, hung temporarily by the neck, some rendered insane for the
time. It is hard to realize that such things could happen in America.
Do we not speak of civilized warfare? Does war necessarily make
fiends of men prematurely? It is a pleasure to report that the
officers at Camp Funston responsible for these outrages were either
dismissed or removed to a different field.</p>

<p>The larger proportion of those imprisoned at Fort Leavenworth
belong to the peace-loving, inoffensive, industrious Mennonites.
Take the case of the Amish Mennonites. Last summer 45
of these quiet people were sentenced to life imprisonment for refusing
to obey the orders of their inferiors in many points of view
except that of military rank. This sentence was commuted to an
imprisonment of 25 years. Twenty-seven of the same sect were
sentenced from 10 to 20 years each for a similar offence. Virtually
in every one of these 72 cases, the crimes consisted in a refusal to
don uniforms. Most of them have longer sentences than are usually
dispensed for manslaughter.</p>

<p>The length of these sentences and also of many other sentences
pronounced upon others who have broken the regulations of the
military code has been made the special object of investigation by
Congress. The excuse that some of these excessively long sentences
were military bluff for the deterrent effect and were never intended
to be carried out in full is irrational. If such statement is correct,
our system of military court procedure ought to be overhauled and
renovated. We are not contending that offenders should go unpunished,
we are merely insisting that the penalties prescribed shall
be commensurate with the offense, and shall be consistent with
modern jurisprudence.</p>

<p>Let us be thankful that the instances of cruelty and preposterous
punishments have been so few. Grant that some of the reported
instances are a species of brutal hazing, that some few bone-headed
young officials “drest in some brief authority,” with an overweening
sense of their importance, have taken a narrow view of military
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
discipline, still there have been sufficient complaints to elicit the
following editorial in the sober Public Ledger of Philadelphia.</p>

<h3>TORTURE FOR MILITARY PRISONERS?</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>“If any branch of the Government’s military activities
calls for an instant and searching investigation, it is certainly
the treatment accorded the “conscientious objectors”
in the military prisons to which they have been sent by
court-martial. Even if half the allegations contained in the
complaints concerning the prisoners of this type, at Governor’s
Island, New York, and at Fort Leavenworth, are
true, the conditions demand instant correction and those
responsible therefor summary punishment.</p>

<p>“In times of war severity of treatment, within the limits
of humanity, is to be expected by those who refuse to fulfill
their obligations to the nation; but the term ‘severity of
treatment’ is an euphemism when used to describe the
experiences of conscientious objectors, shackled, unclothed,
for hours to cell doors, kept for days in dark cells,
and forced for weeks to subsist under physical conditions
which the law would not permit in the case of animals.
If these charges are substantiated, and the outraged sense of
justice of the nation demands that they be either substantiated
or disproved, then the drastic revision of military law
and practice is an imperative duty of Congress which it dare
not ignore or neglect.</p>

<p>“There is abundant reason to believe, in the severity
of the sentences permitted to be imposed by army courts-martial,
that there is lacking in the military mind that sense
of fitness and of humanity which is in accordance with the
age in which we live. The United States cannot with clean
hands ask the nations with which it is allied in the war to
humanize the laws of war while it tolerates inhumanity in the
enforcement of its own military regulations at home. Recalcitrant
soldiers offer a difficult problem, of course; but the
fact is a greater reason for dealing with such offenders with
tact and, above all, with humanity. Torture has no place
in the penology of the day, and least of all in the service
which prides itself on its patriotism.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Acting Committee of The Pennsylvania Society, having
been informed of some instances of punishment which seemed to
resemble soulless European autocratic methods, sent the following
remonstrance to Secretary Baker:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Pennsylvania Prison Society learns with astonishment
and a profound sense of sorrow of the brutal
methods of punishment employed in some of our Federal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Prisons upon military offenders&mdash;especially upon so-called
“Conscientious Objectors” whose only offense is a consistent
adherence to their sense of duty. The studied
attempt to break the spirit of prisoners at Fort Leavenworth
and elsewhere by unspeakable cruelty suggests the
practices of a barbaric past rather than those of a civilized
and enlightened people. Granting that a Nation must at
times deal firmly with political offenders, can any crime ever
justify the employment of cruel and inhumane treatment?
If such barbarous punishment has the sanction of law, then
an outraged sense of justice demands the immediate revision
of our Military Code.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The following note was received, which indicates that the War
Department at Washington has taken measures to relieve the
harsh conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="author">
“<span class="smcap">February 6, 1919.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="nowrap">...</span> The War Department immediately upon
having conditions at the Disciplinary Barracks called to its
attention, instituted an investigation. The report of that
investigation disclosed the fact that the trouble at Leavenworth
was due, not at all to the administration of the
prison, but to the regulations which were ill-adapted to the
unusual type of prisoner that the Selective Service Act
brought to military prisons. The Secretary at once made
some appropriate modifications of those regulations and
has called a conference to consider further changes in
disciplinary regulations, not only to meet this unusual
condition but to bring the Army’s disciplinary methods up
to the most modern penological standards, in case they
shall be found to be deficient. The conference will also
consider ways of meeting the immediate emergency of the
overcrowding of disciplinary barracks due to the increased
size of the Army during the war. The conference will
come to its conclusions in the near future and you may be
assured that action leading out of its conclusions will be
promptly taken.”</p>

<p class="author">
“Very truly,<br />
“F. P. KEPPEL,<br />
“<i>Third Assistant Secretary</i>.”<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Confidential orders, recently made known, of the War Department,
issued in October, 1918, prescribed that those conscripts,
refusing on account of conscientious scruples to perform military
service, should not be treated as traitors or as guilty of rank insubordination.
The Government thus in some form recognized the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
validity of their scruples. As a rule such persons were entirely
segregated from the other men. For a time solitary confinement
was discontinued, but we regret to report that at the military prison
at Leavenworth some 25 of these objectors have recently been
remanded to cellular isolation. One of these men has for some
time been engaged in Christian work under the auspices of the
Y. M. C. A. Very recently he received a visit from a gentleman in
whose office he had often been a visitor, but his mind seemed a
blank, as he did not appear to recognize his visitor who called to
offer services. This mode of punishment was having its logical effect.</p>

<p>We fully endorse the attitude of the U. S. Government as indicated
in its Official Bulletin, No. 113, page 5:&mdash;“Accustomed as
these leaders have been for many years to universal military service,
to a large standing army, <span class="nowrap">...</span> to marked class distinctions,
they have absorbed, and are now wedded to, certain notions which
to us, who have grown up under very different conditions, seem like
worship of constituted authority and the unwarranted surrender
of individual responsibility. The gradual development of these
very notions has brought about an inordinate influence of the
military group in public affairs.”</p>

<p>We rejoice that our Government so clearly sets forth the evils
of a military authority, the spirit of which is so manifestly opposed
to the genius of our free institutions.</p>

<h3 id="PRISON_EXPERIENCES">PRISON EXPERIENCES.</h3>

<p>Within the last few years the general public has been informed
of the real life of the convict by intelligent observers who have
suffered a few days of incarceration in order to gain an insight into
the actual effects of imprisonment. The accounts were interesting
and instructive, but we now have another opportunity to acquire
knowledge of prison conditions from some intelligent and conscientious
persons who have been imprisoned without resorting to a
fake process in order to have such experience. We refer to a class
of offenders who from religious scruples and in some cases for other
reasons have disobeyed the military requirements. We hold no
brief for these offenders, but the observations of some of these persons
are a decided contribution to the science of penology. Making due
allowance for hasty conclusions arrived at from a brief period of
incarceration, and also after insufficient opportunity to grasp the
subject in its entirety, nevertheless, the facts related, and the
arguments and deductions derived from their experiences should
appeal to all who have interest in the reformation of criminals.</p>

<p>Rev. Evan Thomas, a young man of deep religious conviction,
and of a keen sense of injustice, has recently published in <i>The
Survey</i> some details of prison life in the Federal Prison at Leavenworth,
Kansas.</p>

<p>We quote some portions of his article.</p>

<p>“The burden of prison life as I experienced it, however, was
not the physical hardships but the unspeakable moral filth and vice
to which one is constantly exposed. I could not have believed many
of the things I heard and witnessed at Fort Leavenworth had they
been reported to me before going there. No sexual vice or moral
depravity is too low for some of the men confined there. The Disciplinary
Barracks have been called the ‘cess pool for the dregs of
the army.’ But many a fine young soldier whose only offense was
to overstay his leave or be the helpless victim of the antiquated
military law in this country, has found his way among the ‘dregs’
of the army; and as for the others, the great majority are the products
of our reform schools, orphan asylums and jails. These men are
indiscriminately grouped together in the prison. It is true that
there are two so-called honor wings for prisoners in the Disciplinary
Barracks, but I was never able to discover just what was necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
to be assigned to these wings. The information generally given me
by other prisoners was that it was necessary to do ‘some hand-shaking’
first. As a matter of fact, as nearly as I was able to learn,
the power lay very largely in the hands of a group of prisoners, who
through clever politics and the holding of certain important jobs in
the executive office and elsewhere, were able to control things to
a large extent. I was told that even in these honor wings moral
conditions were bad, but in the other wings where men were indiscriminately
alloted, it often happened that diseased men were
assigned to the same cells with others who had to share the same
toilet facilities. The sixth wing, composed of eight tiers of open
cells, each of which contains three double-decked cots and six occupants,
is known as the ‘mad-house’ by the prisoners. Any thoughtful
reading, writing or study in this wing is next to impossible. Before
going into solitary confinement as a protect against the severe treatment
accorded to such conscientious objectors as refused to work, I
spent one day in this wing and the thought of ‘solitary’ lost much of
its dread for me.</p>

<p>“It is certainly possible for the man of wide interests or strong
character to live in such surroundings without any great degree of
moral harm to himself, but for the young, the weak, the very immature,
such conditions are nothing short of ruinous. The conversation
is confined largely to sex, ‘booze’ and the personal daring of the
prisoners. No crime is too terrible and no feat too desperate for most
of these men in their talk. The menace of this sort of thing to those
whose interests are almost entirely within the prison walls is the most
insidious and destructive thing imaginable. Yet no real effort is
made by the authorities to group the prisoners so that at least some
of the men could be spared a great deal of temptation. Much more
serious is the fact that the prison life itself is not calculated to give a
man any interests but those of the basest sort. Self-government is
practically unknown at Fort Leavenworth except in the honor
wings, where I believe the occupants are allowed to elect their own
orderlies.</p>

<p>“At the Disciplinary Barracks there is a department of psychiatry
which takes a very careful record of every prisoner’s history and this
record is faithfully verified by the authorities through letters and
other means of information. But once this record is completed and
on the files, apparently everything has been done that is required.
So far as I was able to observe, at least, no really constructive efforts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
were made to relieve the conditions in the wings which I have spoken
of, where a man of refined sensibilities is often quartered in the same
double-decked bunk with a degenerate or a moral pervert.</p>

<h3>“<span class="smcap">The Failure of Punishment.</span></h3>

<p>“The condition of affairs which I have been attempting to describe
is greatly aggravated by the fact that the idea of punishment and
discipline reigns supreme in the prison. Much is said in the rules and
regulations about the aim of the institution being to improve every
prisoner and turn each man out a better and more useful individual
than when he came in. That is one of the standing jokes of the
prisoners and not without reason, for one has only to read the book
of rules itself to see that the military tradition of punishment and
discipline is the medicine which is expected to work this great transformation.
But unfortunately most of the occupants of a military
prison are there because of their failure or refusal to accept this
military tradition. They are there because they are weak, mentally
and morally, or too independent for the army or because they object
to it on principle.</p>

<p>“So far as I have had experience in life I have yet to observe
anything more absolutely negative in its purpose and effects than
this method of discipline. The prisoner who has the distinction of
having been longest at Fort Leavenworth, had only two more days
of his sentence to complete when a guard called him a vile name,
and utterly regardless of the inevitable consequences this prisoner
knocked the guard down with a brick. He has since received several
extensions of sentence because of other defiant acts. The ball and
chain, solitary confinement and all the other repressive measures of
the prison system have some way not succeeded as yet in turning
this man out of prison a ‘better man than when he came in.’ There
unquestionably is a criminal element in prison that is a menace to
society, but depraved or vicious as some of these men may be, there
is yet some good in every one of them and possibilities of truly
chivalrous conduct in all of them when properly treated. But the
ball and chain, the iron rule, the cursing and foul threats by guards
do not seem to bring out the good side of these men.</p>

<p>“Not long before I was released two men were caught fighting in
the corridor of the wing near my cell. These two men were not
equally guilty. To go into the details of the case would require more
space than I have, but the point I wish to bring out is that they both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
were at once taken to the executive officer of the prison and in ten
minutes were back, sentenced alike, to ten days in the ‘hole’ on
bread and water. The great object of such prison punishment is to
break a man, make him humble, meek and obedient. When this is
done the process of making a man of the prisoner seems to be considered
completed. A guard once told me while I was in solitary that
when he chained a man up backwards as punishment for talking
in solitary, as used to be done, he was generally kind-hearted enough
to let the man down if he repented and asked for it in the ‘right
spirit,’ but if the man was too ‘damned proud to show how much
it hurt him he would let him take his medicine.’ I mention this
because to my mind it is typical of the punishment and discipline
idea of the prison. Actually what happens in this process of breaking
is that the prisoner in the great majority of cases is shoved still further
down the scale of degradation and lack of self-respect. He becomes
either flabby or vicious. This is especially true of such criminal types
as need the helpful, sympathetic and human advice and correction
of trained men above everything else.</p>

<p>“It is my belief that at the bottom of all that I have been trying
to tell, lies not the dishonesty or cruelty of individual officials but
a state of mind shared largely by us all, even prisoners themselves
oftentimes, viz., the idea that the convict is something apart, something
taboo, a person who has forfeited all the rights of normal
human beings, and with this idea goes that of punishment, the
ingrained belief that the only way to deal with viciousness or wrong-doing
is to keep the big stick constantly at hand. This certainly is
the theory of our prisons if one is to judge from the products of our
reform schools and jails whom I met at Fort Leavenworth. These
men very largely had grown up with no other idea of life than that
of the big stick. Put one of these prisoners in authority over others
and in the majority of cases he can be more dictatorial and cruel than
any guard. The supposition is that to make this outcast&mdash;the
prisoner&mdash;bow to authority will make a man of him.</p>

<p>“Prison reform is no easy matter. It must be the work of devoted
and expertly trained men and women. Sentimentalism can play no
part in it and certainly discipline, properly understood, will always
have its place, but it will be discipline in which mutual responsibility,
human sympathy and understanding will replace autocracy and
indifference to the individual and personal element at stake. It is,
perhaps, only fair to say that with the arrival of Major Adler at Fort
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Leavenworth at the beginning of this year certain very important
reforms have been started. But it is going to be a long, uphill fight
which will require the enlightened support of the public if prisons are
ever to cease being a degrading influence in the prisoner’s life to say
nothing of becoming the constructive help that they should be and
can be.”</p>

<h3 id="PROHIBITION_AND_ARRESTS">PROHIBITION AND ARRESTS.<br />

<span class="medium smcap">Harry M. Chalfant.</span></h3>

<p>... We have a detailed report of the number of arrests
in Detroit during the last eight months of license as compared with
the first eight months under prohibition. Detroit became dry
May 1, 1918, and this report covers the two periods of eight months
each, preceding and following that date. It is issued by George H.
Walters, deputy police commissioner. Detroit is the largest city in
the world to experiment with prohibition, it having close to 1,000,000
people.</p>

<p>We have grouped kindred offenses to secure brevity. The first
column shows the number of arrests during the wet period and the
second column shows arrests for the same offenses during the dry
regime. In the third column we have worked out the percentage
of reduction. Under the dry period there were 1511 arrests for
violation of the prohibition law and 550 convictions resulted. These
are omitted from the list because, obviously, no comparison on this
offense could be made. The following figures tell their own story:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Number of Arrests.</span></h3>

<p>It is worthy of note that these results are not materially different
from what happened in the cities of Denver and Seattle, which became
dry January 1, 1916. They afford a hint of what may be possible,
at least to a degree, in Philadelphia after the 1st of next July.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
